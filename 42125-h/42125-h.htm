<h2><i>PART I</i><br /><br />


<a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE CHILD OF SAMSON</small></h2>


<p>It was the evening of a fine September day. Through the square
window, built out so as to form another room almost as large as
that which had been thus enlarged, the autumn sun, now fast
declining to the west, poured in warm and strong; but not too
warm or too strong for the girl on whose head it fell as she sat
leaning back in the low chair, her face turned towards the window.
The sun of Scilly is never too fierce or too burning in summer,
nor in winter does it ever lose its force; in July, when the people
of the adjacent islands of Great Britain and Ireland venture not
forth into the glare of the sun, here the soft sea mists and the
strong sea air temper the heat; and in December the sun still
shines with a lingering warmth, as if he loved the place. This
girl lived in the sunshine all the year round; rowed in it; lay in
it; basked in it bare-headed, summer and winter; in the winter
she would sit sheltered from the wind in some warm corner of the
rocks; in summer she would lie on the hillside or stand upon the
high headlands and the sea-beat crags, while the breezes, which in
the Land of Lyonesse do never cease, played with her long tresses
and kept her soft cheek cool.</p>

<p>The window was wide open on all three sides; the girl had
been doing some kind of work, but it had dropped from her hands,
and now lay unregarded on the floor; she was gazing upon the
scene before her, but with the accustomed eyes which looked out
upon it every day. A girl who has such a picture continually
before her all day long never tires of it, though she may not be
always consciously considering it and praising it. The stranger,
for his part, cannot choose but cry aloud for admiration; but the
native, who knows it as no stranger can, is silent. The house,
half-way up the low hill, looked out upon the south&mdash;to be exact,
its aspect was S. W. by S.&mdash;so that from this window the girl saw
always, stretched out at her feet, the ocean, now glowing in the
golden sunshine of September. Had she been tall enough, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
might even have seen the coast of South America, the nearest land
in the far distance. Looking S. W., that is, she would have seen
the broad mouth of Oroonooque and the shores of El Dorado.
This broad sea-scape was broken exactly in the middle by the
Bishop's Rock and its stately lighthouse rising tall and straight out
of the water; on the left hand the low hill of Annet shut out the
sea; and on the right Great Minalto, rugged and black, the white
foam always playing round its foot or flying over its great black
northern headland, bounded and framed the picture. Almost
in the middle of the water, not more than two miles distant, a
sailing ship, all sails set, made swift way, bound outward one
knows not whither. Lovely at all times is a ship in full sail, but
doubly lovely when she is seen from afar, sailing on a smooth sea,
under a cloudless sky, the sun of afternoon lighting up her white
sails. No other ships were in sight; there was not even the long
line of smoke which proclaims the steamer below the horizon;
there was not even a Penzance fishing-boat tacking slowly homewards
with brown sails and its two masts: in this direction there
was no other sign of man.</p>

<p>The girl, I say, saw this sight every day: she never tired of it,
partly because no one ever tires of the place in which he was born
and has lived&mdash;not even an Arab of the Great Sandy Desert;
partly because the sea, which has been called, by unobservant
poets, unchanging, does in fact change&mdash;face, colour, mood, even
shape&mdash;every day, and is never the same, except, perhaps, when
the east wind of March covers the sky with a monotony of grey,
and takes the colour out of the face of ocean as it takes the colour
from the granite rocks, last year's brown and yellow fern, and the
purple heath. To this girl, who lived with the sea around her,
it always formed a setting, a background, a frame for her thoughts
and dreams. Wherever she went, whatever she said or sang, or
thought or did, there was always in her ears the lapping or the
lashing of the waves; always before her eyes was the white surge
flying over the rocks; always the tumbling waves. But, as for
what she actually thought or what she dreamed, seeing how ignorant
of the world she was, and how innocent and how young, and as for
what was passing in her mind this afternoon as she sat at the
window, I know not. On the first consideration of the thing, one
would be inclined to ask how, without knowledge, can a girl think,
or imagine, or dream anything? On further thought, one understands
that knowledge has very little to do with dreams or fancies.
Yet, with or without knowledge, no poet, sacred bard, or prophet
has ever been able to divine the thoughts of a girl, or to interpret
them, or even to set them down in consecutive language. I suppose
they are not, in truth, thoughts. Thought implies reasoning and
the connection of facts, and the experience of life as far as it has
gone. A young maiden's mind is full of dimly seen shadows and
pallid ghosts which flit across the brain and disappear. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
shadows have the semblance of shape, but it is dim and uncertain:
they have the pretence of colour, but it changes every moment: if
they seem to show a face, it vanishes immediately and is forgotten.
Yet these shadows smile upon the young with kindly eyes; they
beckon with their fingers, and point to where, low down on the
horizon, with cloudy outline, lies the Purple Island&mdash;to such a girl
as this the future is always a small island girt by the sea, far off
and lonely. The shadows whisper to her; they sing to her; but
no girl has ever yet told us&mdash;even if she understands&mdash;what it is
they tell her.</p>

<p>She had been lying there, quiet and motionless, for an hour or
more, ever since the tea-things had been taken away&mdash;at Holy Hill
they have tea at half-past four. The ancient lady who was in the
room with her had fallen back again into the slumber which held
her nearly all day long as well as all the night. The house seemed
thoroughly wrapped and lapped in the softest peace and stillness;
in one corner a high clock, wooden-cased, swung its brass pendulum
behind a pane of glass with solemn and sonorous chronicle of the
moments, so that they seemed to march rather than to fly. A clock
ought not to tick as if Father Time were hurried and driven along
without dignity and by a scourge. This clock, for one, was not
in a hurry. Its tick showed that Time rests not&mdash;but hastes not.
There is admonition in such a clock. When it has no one to
admonish but a girl whose work depends on her own sweet will, its
voice might seem thrown away; yet one never knows the worth of
an admonition. Besides, the clock suited the place and the room.
Where should Time march with solemn step and slow, if not on
the quiet island of Samson, in the archipelago of Scilly? On its face
was written the name of its maker, plain for all the world to see&mdash;'Peter
Trevellick, Penzance, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1741.'</p>

<p>The room was not ceiled, but showed the dark joists and beams
above, once painted, but a long time ago. The walls were wainscotted
and painted drab, after an old fashion now gone out:
within the panels hung coloured prints, which must have been
there since the beginning of this century. They represented rural
subjects&mdash;the farmer sitting before a sirloin of beef, while his wife,
a cheerful nymph, brought him 'Brown George,' foaming with
her best home-brewed; the children hung about his knees
expectant of morsels; or the rustic bade farewell to his sweetheart,
the recruiting-sergeant waiting for him, and the villagers, to
a woman, bathed in tears. There were half a dozen of those compositions
simply coloured. I believe they are now worth much money.
But there were many other things in this room worth money.
Opposite the fireplace stood a cabinet of carved oak, black with
age, precious beyond price. Behind its glass windows one could
see a collection of things once strange and rare&mdash;things which used
to be brought home by sailors long before steamers ploughed every
ocean and globe-trotters trotted over every land. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
wonderful things in coral, white and red and pink; Venus's-fingers
from the Philippines; fans from the Seychelles; stuffed
birds of wondrous hue, daggers and knives, carven tomahawks, ivory
toys, and many other wonders from the far East and fabulous
Cathay. Beside the cabinet was a wooden desk, carved in
mahogany, with a date of 1645, said to have been brought to the
islands by one of the Royalist prisoners whom Cromwell hanged
upon the highest carn of Hangman's Island. There was no escaping
Cromwell&mdash;not even in Scilly any more than in Jamaica. In
one corner was a cupboard, the door standing open. No collector
ever came here to gaze upon the treasures unspeakable of cups and
saucers, plates and punch-bowls. On the mantelshelf were brass
candlesticks and silver candlesticks, side by side with 'ornaments'
of china, pink and gold, belonging to the artistic reign of good King
George the Fourth. On the hearthrug before the fire, which was
always burning in this room all the year round, lay an old dog
sleeping.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the feeling of a room or a house belonging to
the old. Even if the windows are kept open, the air is always
close. Rest, a gentle, elderly angel, sits in the least frequented
room with folded wings. Sleep is always coming to the doors
at all hours: for the sake of Rest and Sleep the house must be
kept very quiet: nobody must ever laugh in the house: there is
none of the litter that children make: nothing is out of its place:
nothing is disturbed: the furniture is old-fashioned and formal:
the curtains are old and faded: the carpets are old, faded, and
worn: it is always evening: everything belonging to the house has
done its work: all together, like the tenant, are sitting still&mdash;solemn,
hushed, at rest, waiting for the approaching end.</p>

<p>The only young thing at Holy Hill was the girl at the window.
Everything else was old&mdash;the servants, the farm labourers, the
house and the furniture. In the great hooded arm-chair beside
the fire reposed the proprietor, tenant, or owner of all. She
was the oldest and most venerable dame ever seen. At this
time she was asleep: her head had dropped forward a little, but
not much; her eyes were closed; her hands were folded in her
lap. She was now so very ancient that she never left her chair
except for her bed; also, by reason of her great antiquity, she now
passed most of the day in sleep, partly awake in the morning, when
she gazed about and asked questions of the day. But sometimes,
as you will presently see, she revived again in the evening, became
lively and talkative, and suffered her memory to return to the
ancient days.</p>

<p>By the assistance of her handmaidens, this venerable lady was
enabled to present an appearance both picturesque and pleasing,
chiefly because it carried the imagination back to a period so very
remote. To begin with, she wore her bonnet all day long. Fifty
years ago it was not uncommon in country places to find very old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ladies who wore their bonnets all day long. Ursula Rosevean, however,
was the last who still preserved that ancient custom. It was a
large bonnet that she wore, a kind of bonnet calculated to impress
very deeply the imagination of one&mdash;whether male or female&mdash;who
saw it for the first time: it was of bold design, as capacious
as a store-ship, as flowing in its lines as an old man-of-war&mdash;inspired
to a certain extent by the fashions of the Waterloo period&mdash;yet,
in great part, of independent design. Those few who were
permitted to gaze upon the bonnet beheld it reverently. Within
the bonnet an adroit arrangement of cap and ribbons concealed
whatever of baldness or exiguity as to locks&mdash;but what does one
know? Venus Calva has never been worshipped by men; and
women only pay their tribute at her shrine from fear&mdash;never from
love. The face of the sleeping lady reminded one&mdash;at first,
vaguely&mdash;of history. Presently one perceived that it was the
identical face which that dread occidental star, Queen Elizabeth
herself, would have assumed had she lived to the age of ninety-five,
which was Ursula's time of life in the year 1884. For it was an
aquiline face, thin and sharp; and if her eyes had been open you
would have remarked that they were bright and piercing, also like
those of the Tudor Queen. Her cheek still preserved something
of the colour which had once made it beautiful; but cheek and
forehead alike were covered with lines innumerable, and her
withered hands seemed to have grown too small for their natural
glove. She was dressed in black silk, and wore a gold chain about
her neck.</p>

<p>The clock struck half-past five, melodiously. Then the girl
started and sat upright&mdash;as awakened out of her dream. 'Armorel,'
it seemed to say&mdash;nay, since it seemed to say, it actually did say&mdash;'Child
Armorel, I am old and wise. For a hundred and forty-three
years, ever since I left the hands of the ingenious Peter Trevellick,
of Penzance, in the year 1741, I have been counting the moments,
never ceasing save at those periods when surgical operations have
been necessary. In each year there are 31,536,000 moments.
Judge, therefore, for yourself how many moments in all I have
counted. I must, you will own, be very wise indeed. I am older
even than your great-great-grandmother. I remember her a baby
first, and then a pretty child, and then a beautiful woman, for all she
is now so worn and wizened. I remember her father and her grandfather.
Also her brothers and her son, and her grandson&mdash;and
your own father, dear Armorel. The moments pass: they never
cease: I tell them as they go. You have but short space to
do all you wish to do. You, child, have done nothing at all yet.
But the moments pass. Patience. For you, too, work will be
found. Youth passes. You can hear it pass. I tell the moments
in which it melts away and vanishes. Age itself shall pass. You may
listen if you please. I tell the moments in which it slowly passes.'</p>

<p>Armorel looked at the clock with serious eyes during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
delivery of this fine sermon, the whole bearing of which she did
not perhaps comprehend. Then she started up suddenly and
sprang to her feet, stung by a sudden pang of restlessness, with a
quick breath and a sigh. We who have passed the noon of life are
apt to forget the disease of restlessness to which youth is prone: it
is an affection which greatly troubles that period of life, though it
should be the happiest and the most contented; it is a disorder due
to anticipation, impatience, and inexperience. The voyage is all
before: youth is eager to be sailing on that unknown ocean full of
strange islands. Who would not be restless with such a journey
before one and such discoveries to make?</p>

<p>Armorel opened the door noiselessly, and slipped out. At the
same moment the old dog awoke and crept out with her, going
delicately and on tiptoe, lest he should awaken the ancient lady.
In the hall outside the girl stood listening. The house was quite
silent, save that from the kitchen there was wafted on the air a
soft droning&mdash;gentle, melodious, and murmurous, like the contented
booming of a bumble-bee among the figwort. Armorel laughed
gently. 'Oh!' she murmured, 'they are all asleep. Grandmother
is asleep in the parlour; Dorcas and Chessun are asleep in the
kitchen; Justinian is asleep in the cottage; and I suppose the boy
is asleep somewhere in the farmyard.'</p>

<p>The girl led the way, and the dog followed.</p>

<p>She passed through the door into the garden of the front. It
was not exactly a well-ordered garden, because everything seemed
to grow as it pleased; but then in Samson you have not to coax
flowers and plants into growing: they grow because it pleases them
to grow: this is the reason why they grow so tall and so fast.
The garden faced the south-west, and was protected from the north
and east by the house itself and by a high stone wall. There is not
anywhere on the island a warmer and sunnier corner than this little
front garden of Holy Hill. The geranium clambered up the walls
beside and among the branches of the tree-fuchsia, both together
covering the front of the house with the rich colouring of their
flowers. On either side of the door grew a great tree, with
gnarled trunk and twisted branches, of lemon verbena, fragrant
and sweet, perfuming the air; the myrtles were like unto trees for
size; the very marguerites ran to timber of the smaller kind; the
pampas-grass in the warmest corner rose eight feet high, waving
its long silver plumes; the tall stalk still stood which had borne
the flowers of an aloe that very summer; the leaves of the plant
itself were slowly dying away, their life-work, which is nothing at
all but the production of that one flowering stem, finished. That
done, the world has no more attractions for the aloe: it is content&mdash;it
slowly dies away. And in the front of the garden was a row
of tall dracæna palms. An old ship's figure-head, thrown ashore
after a wreck, representing the head and bust of a beautiful maiden,
gilded, but with a good deal of the gilt rubbed off, stood on the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hand of the garden, half hidden by another fuchsia-tree in flower:
and a huge old-fashioned ship's lantern hung from an iron bar projecting
over the door of the house.</p>

<p>The house itself was of stone, with a roof of small slates. Impossible
to say how old it was, because in this land stone-work ages
rapidly, and soon becomes covered with yellow and orange lichen,
while in the interstices there grows the grey sandwort; and in the
soft sea air and the damp sea mists the sharp edges even of granite
are quickly rounded off and crumbled. But it was a very old house,
save for the square projecting window, which had been added
recently&mdash;say thirty or forty years ago&mdash;a long, low house of two
storeys, simply built; it stands half-way up the hill which slopes
down to the water's edge; it is protected from the north and north-east
winds, which are the deadliest enemies to Scilly, partly by the
hill behind and partly by a spur of grey rock running like an ancient
Cyclopean wall down the whole face of the hill into the sea, where
for many a fathom it sticks out black teeth, round which the white
surge rises and tumbles, even in the calmest time.</p>

<p>Beyond the garden-wall&mdash;why they wanted a garden-wall I
know not, except for the pride and dignity of the thing&mdash;was a
narrow green, with a little, a very little, pond; in the pond there
were ducks; and beside the green was a small farmyard, containing
everything that a farmyard should contain, except a stable. It
had no stable, because there are no horses or carts upon the island.
Pigs there are, and cows; fowls there are, and ducks and geese,
and a single donkey for the purpose of carrying the flower-baskets
from the farm to the landing-place; but neither horse nor cart.</p>

<p>Beyond the farmyard was a cottage, exactly like the house, but
smaller. It was thatched, and on the thatch grew clumps of samphire.
This was the abode of Justinian Tryeth, bailiff, head man,
or foreman, who managed the farm. When you have named Ursula
Rosevean, and Armorel, her great-great-granddaughter, and
Justinian Tryeth, and Dorcas his wife&mdash;she was a native of St.
Agnes, and therefore a Hicks by birth&mdash;Peter his son, and Chessun
his daughter, you have a complete directory of the island, because
nobody else now lives on Samson. Formerly, however, and almost
within the memory of the oldest inhabitant, according to the computation
of antiquaries and the voice of tradition, this island maintained
a population of over two score.</p>

<p>The hill which rises behind the house is the southern hill of the
two, which, with the broad valley between them, make up the
island of Samson. This hill slopes steeply seaward to south and
west. It is not a lofty hill, by any means. In Scilly there are no
lofty hills. When Nature addressed herself to the construction of
this archipelago she brought to the task a light touch: at the
moment she happened to be full of feeling for the great and
artistic effects which may be produced by small elevations, especially
in those places where the material is granite. Therefore, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
she raised no Alpine peak in Scilly, she provided great abundance
and any variety of bold coast-line with rugged cliffs, lofty carns,
and headlands piled with rocks. And her success as an artist in
this <i>genre</i> has been undoubtedly wonderful. The actual measurement
of Holy Hill, Samson&mdash;but why should we measure?&mdash;has
been taken, for the admiration of the world, by the Ordnance
Survey. It is really no more than a hundred and thirty-two feet&mdash;not
a foot more or less. But then one knows hills ten times that
height&mdash;the Herefordshire Beacon, for example&mdash;which are not
half so mountainous in the effect produced. Only a hundred and
thirty-two feet&mdash;yet on its summit one feels the exhilaration of
spirits caused by the air, elsewhere of five thousand feet at least.
On its southern and western slopes lie the fields which form the
flower-farm of Holy Hill.</p>

<p>Below the farmyard the ground sloped more steeply to the
water: the slope was covered with short heather fern, now brown
and yellow, and long trailing branches of bramble, now laden with
ripe blackberries, the leaves enriched with blazon of gold and
purple and crimson.</p>

<p>Armorel ran across the green and plunged among the fern, tossing
her arms and singing aloud, the old dog trotting and jumping,
but with less elasticity, beside her. She was bare-headed; the sunshine
made her dark cheeks ruddy and caused her black eyes to
glow. Hebe, young and strong, loves Ph&oelig;bus, and fears not any
freckles. When she came to the water's edge, where the boulders
lie piled in a broken mass among and above the water, she stood
still and looked across the sea, silent for a moment. Then she
began to sing in a strong contralto; but no one could hear her, not
even the coastguard on Telegraph Hill, or he of the Star Fort: the
song she sang was one taught her by the old lady, who had sung it
herself in the old, old days, when the road was always filled with
merchantmen waiting for convoy up the Channel, and when the
islands were rich with the trade of the ships, and their piloting, and
their wrecks&mdash;to say nothing of the free trade which went on
gallantly and without break or stop. As she sang she lifted her
arms and swung them in slow cadence, as a Nautch-girl sometimes
swings her arms. What she sang was none other than the
old song&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Early one morning, just as the sun was rising,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a maid sing in the valley below:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh! don't deceive me. Oh! never leave me.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How could you use a poor maiden so?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the year of grace 1884 Armorel was fifteen years of age.
But she looked nineteen or twenty, because she was so tall and so
well-grown. She was dressed simply in a blue flannel; the straw
hat which she carried in her hand was trimmed with red ribbons;
at her throat she had stuck a red verbena&mdash;she naturally took to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
red, because her complexion was so dark. Black hair; black eyes;
a strongly marked brow; a dark cheek of warm and ruddy hue;
the lips full, but the mouth finely curved; features large but
regular&mdash;she was already, though so young, a tall and handsome
woman. Those able to understand things would recognise in
her dark complexion, in her carriage, in her eyes, and in her
upright figure, the true Castilian touch. The gipsy is swarthy; the
negro is black; the mulatto is dusky: it is not the colour alone,
but the figure and the carriage also, which mark the Spanish blood.
A noble Spanish lady; yet how could she get to Samson?</p>

<p>She wore no gloves&mdash;you cannot buy gloves in Samson&mdash;and
her hands were brown with exposure to sea and sun, to wind and
rain: they were by no means tiny hands, but strong and capable
hands; her arms&mdash;no one ever saw them, but for shape and whiteness
they could not be matched&mdash;would have disgraced no young
fellow of her own age for strength and muscle. That was fairly to
be expected in one who continually sailed and rowed across the
inland seas of this archipelago; who went to church by boat and
to market by boat; who paid her visits by boat and transacted her
business by boat, and went by boat to do her shopping. She who
rows every day upon the salt water, and knows how to manage a
sail when the breeze is strong and the Atlantic surge rolls over the
rocks and roughens the still water of the road, must needs be strong
and sound. For my own part, I admire not the fragile maiden so
much as her who rejoices in her strength. Youth, in woman as
well as in man, should be brave and lusty; clean of limb as well as
of heart; strong of arm as well as of will; enduring hardness of
voluntary labour as well as hardness of involuntary pain; with feet
that can walk, run, and climb, and with hands that can hold on.
Such a girl as Armorel&mdash;so tall, so strong, so healthy&mdash;offers, methinks,
a home ready-made for all the virtues, and especially the
virtues feminine, to house themselves therein. Here they will
remain, growing stronger every day, until at last they have become
part and parcel of the very girl herself, and cannot be parted from
her. Whereas, when they visit the puny creature, weak, timid,
delicate&mdash;but no&mdash;'tis better to remain silent.</p>

<p>How many times had the girl wandered, morning or afternoon,
down the rough face of the hill, and stood looking vaguely out to
sea, and presently returned home again? How many such walks
had she taken and forgotten? For a hundred times&mdash;yea, a thousand
times&mdash;we do over and over again the old familiar action, the
little piece of the day's routine, and forget it when we lie down to
sleep. But there comes the thousandth time, when the same thing
is done again in the same way, yet is never to be forgotten. For
on that day happens the thing which changes and charges a whole
life. It is the first of many days. It is the beginning of new days.
From it, whatever may have happened before, everything shall now
be dated until the end. Mohammed lived many years, but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
things that happened unto him or his successors are dated from the
Flight. Is it for nothing that it has been told what things
Armorel did and how she looked on this day? Not so, but for the
sake of what happened afterwards, and because the history of
Armorel begins with this restless fit, which drove her out of the
quiet room down the hillside to the sea. Her history begins, like
every history of a woman worth relating, with the man cast by the
sea upon the shores of her island. The maiden always lives upon
an island, and whether the man is cast upon the shore by the sea
of Society, or the sea of travel, or the sea of accident, or the sea of
adventure, or the sea of briny waves and roaring winds and jagged
rocks, matters little. To Armorel it was the last. To you, dear
Dorothy or Violet, it will doubtless be by the sea of Society. And
the day that casts him before your feet will ever after begin a new
period in your reckoning.</p>

<p>Armorel stopped her song as suddenly as she had begun it.
She stopped because on the water below her, not far from the shore,
she saw a strange thing. She had good sea eyes&mdash;an ordinary
telescope does not afford a field of vision much larger or clearer
across water than Armorel's eyes&mdash;but the thing was so strange that
she shaded her forehead with her hand, and looked more curiously.</p>

<p>It would be strange on any evening, even after the calmest day
of summer, when the sun is setting low, to see a small boat going
out beyond Samson towards the Western Islets. There the swell
of ocean is always rolling among the rocks and round the crags and
headlands of the isles. Only in calm weather and in broad daylight
can the boatman who knows the place venture in those waters.
Not even the most skilled boatman would steer for the Outer
Islands at sunset. For there are hidden rocks, long ridges of teeth
that run out from the islands to tear and grind to powder any boat
that should be caught in their devouring jaws. There are currents
also which run swiftly and unexpectedly between the islands to
sweep the boat along with them till it shall strike the rocks and so
go down with any who are abroad; and there are strong gusts
which sweep round the headlands and blow through the narrow
sounds. So that it is only when the day is calm and in the full
light of the sun that a boat can sail among these islands.</p>

<p>Yet Armorel saw a boat on the water, not half a mile from
Samson, with two men on board. More than this, the boat was
apparently without oars or sails, and it was drifting out to sea.
What did this mean?</p>

<p>She looked and wondered. She looked again, and she remembered.</p>

<p>The tide was ebbing, the boat was floating out with the tide;
the breeze had dropped, but there was still something left&mdash;what
there was came from the south-east and helped the boat along;
there was not much sea, but the feet of Great Minalto were white,
and the white foam kept leaping up the sides, and on her right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
over the ledges round White Island, the water was tearing and
boiling, a white and angry heap. Why, the wind was getting up,
and the sun was setting, and if they did not begin to row back as
hard as they could, and that soon, they would be out to sea and in
the dark.</p>

<p>She looked again, and she thought more. The sinking sun fell
upon the boat, and lit it up so plainly that she could now see very
well two things. First, that the boat was really without any oars
or sails at all; and next, that the two men in her were not natives
of Scilly. She could not discern their faces, but she could tell by
their appearance and the way they sat in the boat that they were
not men of the place. Besides, what would an islander want out
in a boat at such a time and in such a place? They were, therefore,
visitors; and by the quiet way in which they sat, as if it
mattered not at all, it was perfectly plain that they understood
little or nothing of their danger.</p>

<p>Again she considered, and now it became certain to her, looking
down upon the boat, that the current was not taking her out to
sea at all, which would be dangerous enough, but actually straight
on the ridge or ledge of rocks lying off the south-west of White
Island. Then, seized with sudden terror, she turned and fled back
to the farm.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>PRESENTED BY THE SEA</small></h2>


<p>'Peter!' cried Armorel in the farmyard. 'Peter! Peter! Wake
up! Where is the boy? Wake up and come quick!'</p>

<p>The boy was not sleeping, however, and came forth slowly, but
obediently, in rustic fashion. He was a little older than most of
those who still permit themselves to be called boys: unless his
looks deceived one, he was a great deal older, for he was entirely
bald, save for a few long, scattered hairs, which were white. His
beard and whiskers also consisted of nothing but a few sparse white
hairs. He moved heavily, without the spring of boyhood in his
feet. Had Peter jumped or run, one might in haste have inferred
a condition of drink or mental disorder. As for his shoulders, too,
they were rounded, as if by the weight of years&mdash;a thing which is
rarely seen in boys. Yet Armorel called this antique person 'the
boy,' and he answered to the name without remonstrance.</p>

<p>'Quick, Peter!' she cried. 'There's a boat drifting on White
Island Ledge, and the tide's running out strong; and there are
two men in her, and they've got no oars in the boat. Ignorant
trippers, I suppose! They will both be killed to a certainty,
unless&mdash;&mdash; Quick!'</p>

<p>Peter followed her flying footsteps with a show of haste and a
movement of the legs approaching alacrity. But then he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
always a slow boy, and one who loved to have his work done for
him. Therefore, when he reached the landing-place, he found that
Armorel was well before him, and that she had already shipped
mast and sail and oars, and was waiting for him to shove off.</p>

<p>Samson has two landing beaches, one on the north-east below
Bryher Hill, and the other farther south, on the eastern side of
the valley. There might be a third, better than either, on Porth
Bay, if anyone desired to put off there, on the west side facing the
other islands, where nobody has any business at all except to see the
rocks or shoot wild birds.</p>

<p>The beach used by the Holy Hill folk was the second of these
two; here they kept their boats, and had their old stone boat-house
to store the gear; and it was here that Armorel stood
waiting for her companion.</p>

<p>Peter was slow on land; at sea, however, he alone is slow
who does not know what can be got out of a boat, and how it can
be got. Peter did possess this knowledge; all the islanders, in
fact, have it. They are born with it. They also know that nothing
at sea is gained by hurry. It is a maxim which is said to rule or
govern their conduct on land as well as afloat. Peter, therefore,
when he had pushed off, sat down and took an oar with no more
appearance of hurry than if he were taking a boat-load of boxes
filled with flowers across to the port. Armorel took the other oar.</p>

<p>'They are drifting on White Island Ledge,' repeated Armorel;
'and the tide is running out fast.'</p>

<p>Peter made no reply&mdash;Armorel expected none&mdash;but dipped his
oar. They rowed in silence for ten minutes. Then Peter found
utterance, and spoke slowly.</p>

<p>'Twenty years ago&mdash;I remember it well&mdash;a boat went ashore
on that very Ledge. The tide was running out&mdash;strong, like to-night.
There was three men in her&mdash;visitors they were, who
wanted to save the boatman's pay. Their bodies was never
found.'</p>

<p>Then both pulled on in silence, and doggedly.</p>

<p>In ten minutes or more they had rounded the Point at a
respectful distance, for reasons well known to the navigator and
the nautical surveyor of Scilly. Peter, without a word, shipped
his oar. Armorel did likewise. Then Peter stepped the mast and
hoisted the sail, keeping the line in his own hand, and looked
ahead, while Armorel took the helm.</p>

<p>'It's Jinkins's boat,' said Peter, because they were now in sight
of her. 'What'll Jinkins say when he hears that his boat's gone
to pieces?'</p>

<p>'And the two men? Who are they? Will Jinkins say
nothing about the men?'</p>

<p>'Strangers they are; gentlemen, I suppose. Well, if the
breeze doesn't soon&mdash;&mdash; Ah, here it is!'</p>

<p>The wind suddenly filled the sail. The boat heeled over under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the breeze, and a moment after was flying through the water
straight up the broad channel between the two Minaltos and
Samson.</p>

<p>The sun was very low now. Between them and the west lay the
boat they were pursuing&mdash;a small black object, with two black
silhouettes of figures clear against the crimson sky. And now
Armorel perceived that they had by this time gotten an inkling,
at least, of their danger, for they no longer sat passive, but had
torn up a plank from the bottom, with which one, kneeling in the
bows, was working as with a paddle, but without science. The
boat yawed this way and that, but still kept on her course
drifting to the rocks.</p>

<p>'If she touches the Ledge, Peter,' said Armorel, 'she will be
in little bits in five minutes. The water is rushing over it like a
mill-stream.'</p>

<p>This she said ignorant of mill-streams, because there are none
on Scilly; but the comparison served.</p>

<p>'If she touches,' Peter replied, 'we may just go home again.
For we shall be no good to nobody.'</p>

<p>Beyond the boat they could plainly see the waters breaking
over the Ledge; the sun lit up the white foam that leaped and flew
over the black rocks just showing their teeth above the water as
the tide went down.</p>

<p>Here is a problem&mdash;you may find plenty like it in every book
of algebra. Given a boat drifting upon a ledge of rocks with the
current and the tide; given a boat sailing in pursuit with a fair
wind aft; given also the velocity of the current and the speed of
the boat and the distance of the first boat from the rocks: at what
distance must the second boat commence the race in order to catch
up the first before it drives upon the rocks?</p>

<p>This second boat, paying close attention to the problem,
came up hand over hand, rapidly overtaking the first boat,
where the two men not only understood at last the danger they
were in, but also that an attempt was being made to save them.
In fact, one of them, who had some tincture or flavour of the
mathematics left in him from his school days, remembered the
problems of this class, and would have given a great deal to have
been back again in school working out one of them.</p>

<p>Presently the boats were so near that Peter hailed, 'Boat ahoy!
Back her! Back her! or you'll be upon the rocks. Back her all
you know!'</p>

<p>'We've broken our oars,' they shouted.</p>

<p>'Keep her off!' Peter bawled again.</p>

<p>Even with a plank taken from the bottom of the boat a
practised boatman would have been able to keep her off long
enough to clear the rocks; but these two young men were not used
to the ways of the sea.</p>

<p>'Put up your hellum,' said Peter, quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>'What are you going to do?' The girl obeyed first, as one
must do at sea, and asked the question afterwards.</p>

<p>'There's only one chance. We must cut across her bows. Two
lubbers! They ought not to be trusted with a boat. There's
plenty of room.' He looked at the Ledge ahead and at his own
sail. 'Now&mdash;steady.' He tightened the rope, the boat changed
her course. Then Peter stood up and called again, his hand
to his mouth, 'Back her! Back her! Back her all you know!'
He sat down and said quietly, 'Now, then&mdash;luff it is&mdash;luff&mdash;all
you can.'</p>

<p>The boat turned suddenly. It was high time. Right in front
of them&mdash;only a few yards in front&mdash;the water rushed as if over a
cascade, boiling and surging among the rocks. At high tide there
would have been the calm, unruffled surface of the ocean swell;
now there were roaring floods and swelling whirlpools. The girl
looked round, but only for an instant. Then the boat crossed the
bows of the other, and Armorel, as they passed, caught the rope
that was held out to her.</p>

<p>One moment more and they were off the rocks, in deep water,
towing the other boat after them.</p>

<p>Then Peter arose, lowered the sail, and took down his mast.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' he said, 'between us and Mincarlo. Now, gentlemen,
if you will step into this boat we can tow yours along with us.
So&mdash;take care, sir! Sit in the stern beside the young lady. Can
you row, either of you?'</p>

<p>They could both row, they said. In these days a man is as
much ashamed of not being able to row as, fifty years ago, he was
ashamed of not being able to ride. Peter took one oar and gave
the other to the stranger nearest. Then, without more words, he
dipped his oar and began to row back again. The sun went down,
and it suddenly became cold.</p>

<p>Armorel perceived that the man beside her was quite a young
man&mdash;not more than one- or two-and-twenty. He wore brave
attire&mdash;even a brown velvet jacket, a white waistcoat, and a crimson
necktie; he also had a soft felt hat. Nature had not yet given
him much beard, but what there was of it he wore pointed, with a
light moustache so arranged as to show how it would be worn when
it became of a respectable length. As he sat in the boat he seemed
tall; and he did not look at all like one of the bawling and
boastful trippers who sometimes come over to the islands for a
night and pretend to know how to manage a boat. Yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'What do you mean,' asked the girl, severely, 'by going out in
a boat, when you ought to have known very well that you could
not manage her?'</p>

<p>'We thought we could,' replied this disconcerted pretender,
with meekness suitable to the occasion. Indeed, under such
humiliating circumstances, Captain Parolles himself would become
meek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>'If we had not seen you,' she continued, 'you would most
certainly have been killed.'</p>

<p>'I begin to think we might. We should certainly have gone
on those rocks. But there is an island close by. We could swim.'</p>

<p>'If your boat had touched those rocks you would have been
dead in three minutes,' this maid of wisdom continued. 'Nothing
could have saved you. No boat could have come near you. And
to think of standing or swimming in that current and among those
rocks! Oh! but you don't know Scilly.'</p>

<p>'No,' he replied, still with a meekness that disarmed wrath,
'I'm afraid not.'</p>

<p>'Tell me how it happened.'</p>

<p>The other man struck in&mdash;he who was wielding the oar. He
also was a young man, of shorter and more sturdy build than the
other. Had he not, unfortunately, confined his whole attention in
youth to football, he might have made a good boatman. Really, a
young man whose appearance conveyed no information or suggestion
at all about him except that he seemed healthy, active, and
vigorous, and that he was presumably short-sighted, or he would
not have worn spectacles.</p>

<p>'I will tell you how it came about,' he said. 'This man would
go sketching the coast. I told him that the islands are so beautifully
and benevolently built that every good bit has got another
bit on the next island, or across a cove, or on the other side of a
bay, put there on purpose for the finest view of the first bit. You
only get that arrangement, you know, in the Isles of Scilly and
the Isles of Greece. But he wouldn't be persuaded, and so we took
a boat and went to sea, like the three merchants of Bristol city.
We saw Jerusalem and Madagascar very well, and if you hadn't
turned up in the nick of time I believe we should have seen the
river Styx as well, with Cocytus very likely: good old Charon
certainly: and Tantalus, too much punished&mdash;overdone&mdash;up to his
neck.'</p>

<p>Armorel heard, wondering what, in the name of goodness, this
talker of strange language might mean.</p>

<p>'When his oar broke, you know,' the talker went on, 'I began
to laugh, and so I caught a crab; and while I lay in the bottom
laughing like Tom of Bedlam, my oar dropped overboard, and
there we were. Five mortal hours we drifted; but we had tobacco
and a flask, and we didn't mind so very much. Some boat, we
thought, might pick us up.'</p>

<p>'Some boat!' echoed Armorel. 'And outside Samson!'</p>

<p>'As for the rocks, we never thought about them. Had we
known of the rocks, we should not have laughed&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You have saved our lives,' said the young man in the velvet
jacket. He had a soft sweet voice, which trembled a little as he
spoke. And, indeed, it is a solemn thing to be rescued from certain
death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>'Peter did it,' Armorel replied. 'You may thank Peter.'</p>

<p>'Let me thank you,' he said, softly and persuasively. 'The
other man may thank Peter.'</p>

<p>'Just as you like. So long, that is, as you remember that it
will have to be a lesson to you as long as you live never to go out in
a boat without a man.'</p>

<p>'It shall be a lesson. I promise. And the man I go out with,
next time, shall not be you, Dick.'</p>

<p>'Never,' she went on, enforcing the lesson, 'never go in a boat
alone, unless you know the waters. Are you Plymouth trippers?
But then Plymouth people generally know how to handle a boat.'</p>

<p>'We are from London.' In the twilight the blush caused by
being taken for a Plymouth tripper was not perceived. 'I am an
artist, and I came to sketch.' He said this with some slight
emphasis and distinction. There must be no mistaking an artist
from London for a Plymouth tripper.</p>

<p>'You must be hungry.'</p>

<p>'We are ravenous, but at this moment one can only feel that it
is better to be hungry and alive than to be drowned and dead.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said, earnestly, 'you don't know how strong the
water is. It would have thrown you down and rolled you over and
over among the rocks, your head would have been knocked to pieces,
your face would have been crushed out of shape, every bone would
have been broken: Peter has seen them so.'</p>

<p>'Ay! ay!' said Peter. 'I've picked 'em up just so. You are
well off those rocks, gentlemen.'</p>

<p>Silence fell upon them. The twilight was deepening, the breeze
was chill. Armorel felt that the young man beside her was shivering&mdash;perhaps
with the cold. He looked across the dark water and
gasped: 'We are coming up,' he said, 'out of the gates of death
and the jaws of hell. Strange! to have been so near unto dying.
Five minutes more, and there would have been an end, and two
more men would have been created for no other purpose but to be
drowned.'</p>

<p>Armorel made no reply. The oars kept dipping, dipping,
evenly and steadily. Across the waters on either hand flashed
lights: St. Agnes and the Bishop from the south&mdash;they are white
lights; and from the north the crimson splendour of Round
Island: the wind was dropping, and there was a little phosphorescence
on the water, which gleamed along the blade of the oar.</p>

<p>In half an hour the boat rounded the new pier, and they were
in the harbour of Hugh Town at the foot of the landing steps.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Armorel, 'you had better get home as fast as you
can and have some supper.'</p>

<p>'Why,' cried the artist, realising the fact for the first time,
'you are bare-headed! You will kill yourself.'</p>

<p>'I am used to going about bare-headed. I shall come to no
harm. Now go and get some food.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>'And you?' The young man stood on the stepping-stones
ready to mount.</p>

<p>'We shall put up the sail and get back to Samson in twenty
minutes. There is breeze enough for that.'</p>

<p>'Will you tell us,' said the artist, 'before you go&mdash;to whom we
are indebted for our very lives?'</p>

<p>'My name is Armorel.'</p>

<p>'May we call upon you? To-night we are too bewildered.
We cannot say what we ought and must say.'</p>

<p>'I live on Samson. What is your name?'</p>

<p>'My name is Roland Lee. My friend here is called Dick
Stephenson.'</p>

<p>'You can come if you wish. I shall be glad to see you,'
she corrected herself, thinking she had been inhospitable and
ungracious.</p>

<p>'Am I to ask for Miss Armorel?'</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. 'You will find no one to ask, I am
afraid. Nobody else, you see, lives on Samson. When you land,
just turn to the left, walk over the hill, and you will find the
house on the other side. Samson is not so big that you can
miss the house. Good-night, Roland Lee! Good-night, Dick
Stephenson!'</p>

<p>'She's only a child,' said the young man called Dick, as he
climbed painfully and fearfully up the dark and narrow steps,
slippery with sea-weed and not even protected by an inner bar.
'I suppose it doesn't much matter since she's only a child. But I
merely desire to point out that it's always the way. If there does
happen to be an adventure accompanied by a girl&mdash;most adventures
bring along the girl: nobody cares, in fact, for an adventure without
a girl in it&mdash;I'm put in the background and made to do the
work while you sit down and talk to the girl. Don't tell me it was
accidental. It was the accident of design. Hang it all! I'll turn
painter myself.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>IN THE BAR PARLOUR</small></h2>


<p>At nine o'clock the little bar parlour of Tregarthen's was nearly
full. It is a very little room, low as well as little, therefore
it is easily filled. And though it is the principal club-room of
Hugh Town, where the better sort and the notables meet, it can
easily accommodate them all. They do not, however, meet every
evening, and they do not all come at once. There is a wooden
settle along the wall, beautifully polished by constant use, which
holds four: a smaller one beside the fire, where at a pinch two
might sit; there is a seat in the window which also might hold
two, but is only comfortable for one. A small round table only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
leaves room for one chair. This makes sitting accommodation for
nine, and when all are present, and all nine are smoking tobacco
like one, the atmosphere is convivially pungent. This evening
there were only seven. They consisted of the two young men
whose perils on the deep you have just witnessed; a Justice of
the Peace&mdash;but his office is a sinecure, because on the Scilly Isles
virtue reigns in every heart; a flower-farmer of the highest standing;
two other gentlemen weighed down with the mercantile
anxieties and interests of the place&mdash;they ought to have been in
wigs and square brown coats, with silver buckles to their shoes;
and one who held office and exercised authority.</p>

<p>The art of conversation cannot be successfully cultivated on a
small island, on board ship, or in a small country town. Conversation
requires a continual change of company, and a great variety
of topics. Your great talker, when he inconsiderately remains
too long among the same set, becomes a bore. After a little,
unless he goes away, or dies, or becomes silent, they kill him, or
lock him up in an asylum. At Tregarthen's he would be made to
understand that either he or the rest of the population must
leave the archipelago and go elsewhere. In some colonial circles
they play whist, which is an excellent method, perhaps the best
ever invented, for disguising the poverty or the absence of conversation.
At Tregarthen's they do not feel this necessity&mdash;they are
contented with their conversation; they are so happily contented
that they do not repine even though they get no more than an
observation dropped every ten minutes or so. They are not
anxious to reply hurriedly; they are even contented to sit silently
enjoying the proximity of each other&mdash;the thing, in fact, which
lies at the root of all society. The evening is not felt to be dull,
though there are no fireworks of wit and repartee. Indeed, if
Douglas Jerrold himself were to appear with a bag full of the most
sparkling epigrams and repartees, nobody would laugh, even when
he was kicked out into the cold and unappreciative night&mdash;the
stars have no sense of humour&mdash;as a punishment for impudence.</p>

<p>This evening the notables spoke occasionally; they spoke
slowly&mdash;the Scillonians all talk slowly&mdash;they neither attempted nor
looked for smartness. They did not tell stories, because all the
stories are known, and they can now only be told to strangers.
The two young men from London listened without taking any part
in the talk: people who have just escaped&mdash;and that narrowly&mdash;a
sharp and painful death by drowning and banging on jagged
rocks are expected to be hushed for awhile. But they listened.
And they became aware that the talk, in whatever direction it
wandered, always came back to the sea. Everything in Scilly
belongs to the sea: they may go up country, which is a journey of
a mile and a half, or even two miles&mdash;and speak for a moment of
the crops and the farms; but that leads to the question of import
and export, and, therefore, to the vessels lying within the pier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and to the steam service to Penzance and to vessels in other ports,
and, generally, to steam service about the world. And again,
wherever two or three are gathered together in Scilly, one at least
will be found to have ploughed the seas in distant parts. This
confers a superiority on the society of the islands which cannot,
even in these days, be denied or concealed. In the last century,
when a man who was known to have crossed the Pacific entered a
coffee-house, the company with one accord gazed upon him with
envy and wonder. Even now, familiarity hath not quite bred
contempt. We still look with unconcealed respect upon one who
can tell of Tahiti and the New Hebrides, and has stood upon the
mysterious shores of Papua. And, at Tregarthen's this evening,
these two strangers were young; they had not yet made the circuit
of the round earth; they had had, as yet, not many opportunities
of talking with travellers and sailors. Therefore, they listened,
and were silent.</p>

<p>Presently, one after the other, the company got up and went
out. There is no sitting late at night in Scilly. There were left
of all only the Permanent Official.</p>

<p>'I hear, gentlemen,' he said, 'that you have had rather a nasty
time this evening.'</p>

<p>'We should have been lost,' said the artist, 'but for a&mdash;young
lady, who saw our danger and came out to us.'</p>

<p>'Armorel. I saw her towing in your boat and landing you.
Yes, it was a mighty lucky job that she saw you in time. There's
a girl! Not yet sixteen years old! Yet I'd rather trust myself
with her in a boat, especially if she had the boy Peter with her,
than any boatman of the islands. And there's not a rock or an
islet, not a bay or a headland in this country of bays and capes and
rocks, that she does not know. She could find her way blindfold
by the feel of the wind and the force of the current. But it's in
her blood. Father to son&mdash;father to son and daughter too&mdash;the
Roseveans are born boatmen.'</p>

<p>'She saved our lives,' repeated the artist. 'That is all we
know of her. It is a good deal to know, perhaps, from our own
point of view.'</p>

<p>'She belongs to Samson. They've always lived on Samson.
Once there were Roseveans, Tryeths, Jenkinses, and Woodcocks
on Samson. Now, they are nearly all gone&mdash;only one family of
Rosevean left, and one of Tryeth.'</p>

<p>'She said that nobody else lived there.'</p>

<p>'Well, it is only her own family. They've started a flower-farm
lately on Holy Hill, and I hear it's doing pretty well. It's a
likely situation, too, facing south-west and well sheltered. You
should go and see the flower-farm. Armorel will be glad to show
you the farm, and the island too. Samson has got a good many
curious things&mdash;more curious, perhaps, than she knows, poor child!'</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and then continued: 'There's nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
on the island now but themselves. There's the old woman, first&mdash;you
should see her too. She's a curiosity by herself&mdash;Ursula
Rosevean&mdash;she was a Traverse, and came from Bryher to be
married. She married Methusalem Rosevean, Armorel's great-great-grandfather&mdash;that
was nigh upon eighty years ago; she's
close upon a hundred now; and she's been a widow since&mdash;when
was it?&mdash;I believe she'd only been a wife for twelve months or so.
He was drowned on a smuggling run&mdash;his brother Emanuel, too.
Widow used to look for him from the hill-top every night for a
year and more afterwards. A wonderful old woman! Go and
look at her. Perhaps she will talk to you. Sometimes, when
Armorel plays the fiddle, she will brighten up and talk for an hour.
She knows how to cure all diseases, and she can foretell the future.
But she's too old now, and mostly she's asleep. Then there's
Justinian Tryeth and Dorcas, his wife&mdash;they're over seventy, both
of them, if they're a day. Dorcas was a St. Agnes girl&mdash;that's the
reason why her name was Hicks: if she'd come from Bryher she'd
have been a Traverse; if from Tresco she'd have been a Jenkins.
But she was a Hicks. She's as old as her husband, I should say.
As for the boy, Peter&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She called him the boy, I remember. But he seemed to
me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'He's fifty, but he's always been the boy. He never married,
because there was nobody left on Samson for him to marry, and
he's always been too busy on the farm to come over here after a
wife. And he looks more than fifty, because once he fell off the
pier, head first, into the stern of a boat, and after he'd been unconscious
for three days, all his hair fell off except a few stragglers,
and they'd turned white. Looks most as old as his father.
Chessun's near fifty-two.'</p>

<p>'Who is Chessun?'</p>

<p>'She's the girl. She's always been the girl. She's never
married, just like Peter her brother, because there was no one left
on Samson for her. And she never leaves the island except once
or twice a year, when she goes to the afternoon service at Bryher.
Well, gentlemen, that's all the people left on Samson. There used
to be more&mdash;a great many more&mdash;quite a population, and if all
stories are true, they were a lively lot. You'll see their cottages
standing in ruins. As for getting drowned, you'd hardly believe!
Why, take Armorel alone. Her father, Emanuel&mdash;he'd be about
fifty-seven now&mdash;he was drowned&mdash;twelve years ago it must be
now&mdash;with his wife and his three boys, Emanuel, John, and
Andrew, crossing over from a wedding at St. Agnes. He married
Rovena Wetherel, from St. Mary's. Then there was her grandfather,
he was a pilot&mdash;but they were all pilots&mdash;and he was cast
away taking an East Indiaman up the Channel, cast away on Chesil
Bank in a fog&mdash;that was in the year 1845&mdash;and all hands lost. His
father&mdash;no, no, that was his uncle&mdash;all in the line were drowned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that one's uncle died in his bed unexpectedly&mdash;you can see the bed
still&mdash;but they do say, just before some officers came over about a
little bit of business connected with French brandy. One of the
Roseveans went away, and became a purser in the Royal Navy.
Those were the days for pursers! Their accounts were never
audited, and when they'd squared the captain and paid him the
wages and allowances for the dummies and the dead men, they had
left as much&mdash;ay, as a couple of thousand a year. After this he
left the Navy and purveyed for the Fleet, and became so rich that
they had to make him a knight.'</p>

<p>'Was there much smuggling here in the old days?'</p>

<p>'Look here, sir; a Scillonian in the old days called himself a
pilot, a fisherman, a shopkeeper, or a farmer, just as he pleased.
That was his pleasant way. But he was always&mdash;mind you&mdash;a
smuggler. Armorel's great-great-great-grandfather, father of the
old lady's husband&mdash;him who was never heard of afterwards, but
was supposed to have been cast away off the French coast&mdash;he was
known to have made great sums of money. Never was anyone on
the islands in such a big way. Lots of money came to the islands
from smuggling. They say that the St. Martin's people have kept
theirs, and have got it invested; but, for all the rest, it's gone.
And they were wreckers too. Many and many a good ship before
the islands were lit up have struck on the rocks and gone to pieces.
What do you think became of the cargoes? Where were the Scilly
boats when the craft was breaking up? And did you never hear of
the ship's lantern tied to the horns of a cow? They've got one on
Samson could tell a tale or two; and they've still got a figure-head
there which ought to have haunted old Emanuel Rosevean when
his boat capsized off the coast of France.'</p>

<p>'An interesting family history.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Until the Preventive Service put an end to the trade,
the Roseveans were the most successful and the most daring
smugglers in the islands. But an unlucky family. All these
drownings make people talk. Old wives' talk, I dare say. But
for something one of them did&mdash;wrecking a ship, robbing the dead,
who knows&mdash;they say the bad luck will go on till something is
done&mdash;I know not what.'</p>

<p>He got up and put on his cap, the blue-cloth cap with a cloth
peak, much affected in Scilly, because the wind blows off any other
form of hat ever invented.</p>

<p>'It is ten o'clock&mdash;I must go. Did you ever hear the story,
gentlemen, of the Scillonian sailor?' He sat down again. 'I
believe it must have been one of the Roseveans. He was on board
a West Indiaman, homeward bound, and the skipper got into a fog
and lost his reckoning. Then he asked this man if he knew the
Scilly Isles. "Better nor any book," says the sailor. "Then,"
says the skipper, "take the wheel." In an hour crash went the
ship upon the rocks. "Damn your eyes!" says the skipper, "you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
said you knew the Scilly Isles." "So I do," says the man; "this
is one of 'em." The ship went to pieces, and near all the hands
were lost. But the people of the islands had a fine time with the
flotsam and the jetsam for a good many days afterwards.'</p>

<p>'I believe,' said the young man&mdash;he who answered to the name
of Dick&mdash;'that this patriot is buried in the old churchyard. I saw
an inscription to-day which probably marks his tomb. Under the
name is written the words "Dulce et decor"&mdash;but the rest is
obliterated.'</p>

<p>'Very likely&mdash;they would bury him in the old churchyard.
Good-night, gentlemen!'</p>

<p>'Roland!' The young man called Dick jumped from the settle.
'Roland! Pinch me&mdash;shake me&mdash;stick a knife into me&mdash;but not
too far&mdash;I feel as if I was going off my head. The fair Armorel's
father was a corsair, who was drowned on his way from the coast
of France, with his grandfather and his great-grandfather and great-grand-uncles,
after having been cast away upon the Chesil Bank,
and never heard of again, though he was wanted on account of a
keg of French brandy picked up in the Channel. He made an
immense pile of money, which has been lost; and there's an old
lady at the farm so old&mdash;so old&mdash;so very, very old&mdash;it takes your
breath away only to think of it&mdash;that she married Methusalem.
Her husband was drowned&mdash;a new light, this, on history&mdash;and of
course she escaped on the Ark&mdash;as a stowaway or a cabin passenger.
Armorel plays the fiddle and makes the old lady jump.'</p>

<p>'We'll go over there to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'We will. It is a Land of Enchantment, this outlying bit of
Lyonesse. Meanwhile, just to clear my brain, I think I must have
a whisky. The weakness of humanity demands it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! 'twas in Tregarthen's bar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the pipes and whiskies are&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are an unlucky family,' he went on, 'because they "did something."
Remark, Roland, that here is the very element of romance.
My ancestors have "done something" too. I am sure they have,
because my grandfather kept a shop, and you can't keep a shop
without "doing something." But Fate never persecuted my
father, the dean, and I am not in much anxiety that I too shall be
shadowed on account of the old man. Yet look at Armorel
Rosevean! There's distinction, mind you, in being selected by
Fate for vicarious punishment. The old corsair wrecked a ship
and robbed the bodies: therefore, all his descendants have got to
be drowned. Dear me! If we were all to be drowned because
our people had once "done something," the hungry, insatiate
sea would be choked, and the world would come to an end. A
Scotch whisky, Rebecca, if you please, and a seltzer! To-morrow,
Roland, we will once more cross the raging main, but under
protection. If you break an oar again, you shall be put overboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
We will visit this fair child of Samson. Child of Samson!
The Child of Samson! Was Delilah her mother, or is she the
grand daughter of the Timnite? Has she inherited the virtues
of her father as well as his strength? Were the latter days of
Delilah sanctified and purified? Happily, she is only as yet a child&mdash;only
a child, Roland'&mdash;he emphasised the words&mdash;'although a
child of Samson.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the night a vision came to Roland Lee. He saw Armorel
once more sailing to his rescue. And in his vision he was seized
with a mighty terror and a shaking of the limbs, and his heart
sank and his cheek blanched; and he cried aloud, as he sank beneath
the cold waters: 'Oh, Armorel, you have come too late!
Armorel, you cannot save me now.'</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE GOLDEN TORQUE</small></h2>


<p>The morning was bright, the sky blue, the breeze fresh&mdash;so
fresh that even in the Road the sea broke over the bows and
the boat ran almost gunwale under. This time the two lands-men
were not unprotected: they were in charge of two boatmen.
Humiliating, perhaps; but your true courage consisteth not in
vain boasting and arrogant pretence, and he is safest who doth not
ignorantly presume to manage a boat. Therefore, boatmen twain
now guided the light bark and held the ropes.</p>

<p>'Dick,' said Roland, presently, looking ahead, 'I see her. There
she is&mdash;upon the hillside among the brown fern. I can see her,
with her blue dress.'</p>

<p>Dick looked, and shook his short-sighted head.</p>

<p>'I only see Samson,' he said. 'He groweth bigger as we
approach. That is not uncommon with islands. I perceive that
he hath two hills, one on the north and the other on the south; he
showeth&mdash;perhaps with pride&mdash;a narrow plain in the middle. The
hills appear to be strewn with boulders, and there are carns, and
perhaps Logan stones. There is always a Logan stone, but you
can never find it. There are also, I perceive, ruins. Samson looks
quite a large island when you come near to it. Life on Samson
must be curiously peaceful. No post-office, no telegrams, no
telephones, no tennis, no shops, no papers, no people&mdash;good
heavens! For a whole month one would enjoy Samson.'</p>

<p>'Don't you see her?' repeated Roland. 'She is coming down
the hillside.'</p>

<p>'I dare say I do see her if I knew it; but I cannot at this distance,
even with assisted eyes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! a blue dress&mdash;blue&mdash;against the brown and yellow of the
fern. Can you not&mdash;&mdash;?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick gazed with the slow, uncertain eyes of short sight, and
adjusted his glasses.</p>

<p>'My pal,' he said, 'to please you I would pretend to see
anything. In fact, I always do: it saves trouble. I see her
plainly&mdash;blue dress, you say&mdash;certainly&mdash;sitting on a rock&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nonsense! She is walking down the hill. You don't see her
at all.'</p>

<p>'Quite so. Coming down the hill,' Dick replied, unmoved.</p>

<p>'She has been in my mind all night. I have been thinking all
kinds of things&mdash;impossible things&mdash;about this nymph. She is
not in the least common, to begin with. She is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She is only a child, Roland. Don't&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A child? Why shouldn't she be a child? I suppose I may
admire a beautiful child? Do you insinuate that I am going to
make love to her?'</p>

<p>'Well, old man, you mostly do.'</p>

<p>'It was not so dark last night but one could see that she is a
very beautiful girl. She looks eighteen, but our friend last night
assured us that she is not yet sixteen. A very beautiful girl she
is: features regular, and a head that ought to be modelled. She
is dark, like a Spaniard.'</p>

<p>'Gipsy, probably. Name of Stanley or Smith&mdash;Pharaoh Stanley
was, most likely, her papa.'</p>

<p>'Gipsy yourself! Who ever heard of a gipsy on Scilly? You
might as well look for an organ-grinder! Spanish blood, I swear!
Castilian of the deepest blue. Then her eyes! You didn't observe
her eyes?'</p>

<p>'I was too hungry. Besides, as usual, I was doing all the
work.'</p>

<p>'They are black eyes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The Romany have black eyes&mdash;roving eyes&mdash;hard, bold, bad,
black eyes.'</p>

<p>'Soft black&mdash;not hard black. The dark velvet eyes which hold
the light. Dick, I should like to paint those eyes. She is now
looking at our boat. I can see her lifting her hand to shade her
eyes. I should like to paint those eyes just at the moment when
she gives away her heart.'</p>

<p>'You cannot, Childe Roland, because there could only be one
other person present on that interesting occasion. And that person
must not be you.'</p>

<p>'Dick, too often you are little better than an ass.'</p>

<p>'If you painted those eyes when she was giving away her heart
it might lead to another and a later picture when she was giving
away her temper. Eyes which hold the light also hold the fire.
You might be killed with lightning, or, at least, blinded with excess
of light. Take care!'</p>

<p>'Better be blinded with excess of light than pass by insensible.
Some men are worse than the fellow with the muck-rake. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was only insensible to a golden crown; they are insensible to
Venus. Without loveliness, where is love? Without love, what
is life?'</p>

<p>'Yet,' said Dick, drily, 'most of us have got to shape our lives
for ourselves before we can afford to think of Venus.'</p>

<p>It will be understood that these two young men represented
two large classes of humanity. One would not go so far as to say
that mankind may be divided into those two classes only: but,
undoubtedly, they are always with us. First, the young man who
walketh humbly, doing his appointed task with honesty, and
taking with gratitude any good thing that is bestowed upon him
by Fate. Next, the young man who believes that the whole round
world and all that therein is are created for his own special
pleasure and enjoyment; that for him the lovely girls attire
themselves, and for his pleasure go forth to dance and ball; for
him the actress plays her best; for him the feasts are spread, the
corks are popped, the fruits are ripened, the suns shine. To the
former class belonged Dick Stephenson: to the latter, Roland Lee.
Indeed, the artistic temperament not uncommonly enlists a young
man in the latter class.</p>

<p>'Look!' cried the artist. 'She sees us. She is coming down
the hill. Even you can see her now. Oh! the light, elastic step!
Nothing in the world more beautiful than the light, elastic step
of a girl. Somehow, I don't remember it in pictures. Perhaps&mdash;some
day&mdash;I may&mdash;&mdash;' He began to talk in unconnected jerks.
'As for the Greek maiden by the sea-shore playing at ball and
showing bony shoulders, and all that&mdash;I don't like it. Only very
young girls should play at ball and jump about&mdash;not women grown
and formed. They may walk or spring as much as they like, but
they must not jump, and they must not run. They must not
laugh loud. Violent emotions are masculine. Figure and dress
alike make violence ungraceful: that is why I don't like to see
women jump about. If they knew how it uglifies most of them!
Armorel is only a child&mdash;yes&mdash;but how graceful, how complete she
is in her movements!'</p>

<p>She was now visible, even to a short-sighted man, tripping
lightly through the fern on the slope of the hill. As she ran, she
tossed her arms to balance herself from boulder to boulder. She
was singing, too, but those in the boat could not hear her; and
before the keel touched the sand she was silent.</p>

<p>She stood waiting for them on the beach, her old dog Jack
beside her, a smile of welcome in her eyes, and the sunlight on her
cheeks. Hebe herself&mdash;who remained always fifteen from prehistoric
times until the melancholy catastrophe of the fourth
century, when, with the other Olympians, she was snuffed out&mdash;was
not sweeter, more dainty, or stronger, or more vigorous of aspect.</p>

<p>'I thought you would come across this morning,' she said. 'I
went to the top of the hill and looked out, and presently I saw your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
boat. You have not ventured out alone again, I see. Good-morning,
Roland Lee! Good-morning, Dick Stephenson!'</p>

<p>She called them thus by their Christian names, not with
familiarity, but quite naturally, and because when she went into
the world&mdash;that is to say, to Bryher Church&mdash;on Sunday afternoon,
each called unto each by his Christian name. And to each
she gave her hand with a smile of welcome. But it seemed to
Dick, who was observant rather than jealous, that his companion
appropriated to himself and absorbed both smiles.</p>

<p>'Shall I show you Samson? Have you seen the islands yet?'</p>

<p>No; they had only arrived two days before, and were going
back the next day.</p>

<p>'Many do that,' said the girl. 'They stay here a day or two:
they go across to Tresco and see the gardens: then perhaps they
walk over Sallakey Down, and they see Peninnis and Porthellick
and the old church, and they think they have seen the islands.
You will know nothing whatever about Scilly if you go to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Why should we go to-morrow?' asked the artist. 'Tell me,
that, Dick.'</p>

<p>'I, because my time is up, and Somerset House once more expects
me. You, my friend,' Dick replied, with meaning, 'because you
have got your work to do and you must not fool around any longer.'</p>

<p>Roland Lee laughed. 'We came first of all,' he said, turning
to Armorel, 'in order to thank you for&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! you thanked me last night. Besides it was Peter&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, no. I refuse to believe in Peter.'</p>

<p>'Well, do not let us say any more about it. Come with me.'</p>

<p>The landing-place of Samson is a flat beach, covered with a
fine white sand and strewn with little shells&mdash;yellow and grey,
green and blue. Behind the beach is a low bank on which grow
the sea-holly, the sea-lavender, the horned poppy, and the spurge,
and behind the bank stretches a small plain, low and sandy, raised
above the high tide by no more than a foot or two. Armorel
led the way across this plain to the foot of the northern hill. It is
a rough and rugged hill, wild and uncultivated. The slope facing
the south is covered with gorse and fern, the latter brown and
yellow in September. Among the fern at this season stood the
tall dead stalks of foxglove. Here and there were patches of short
turf set about with the withered flowers of the sea-pink, and the
long branches of the bramble lay trailing over the ground. The
hand of some prehistoric giant has sprinkled the slopes of this hill
with boulders of granite: they are piled above each other so as to
make carns, headlands, and capes with strange resemblances and
odd surprises. Upon the top they found a small plateau sloping
gently to the north.</p>

<p>'See!' said Armorel. 'This is the finest thing we have to
show on Samson, or on any of the islands. This is the burial-place
of the kings. Here are their tombs.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>'What kings?' asked Dick, looking about him. 'Where are
the tombs?'</p>

<p>'The kings,' Roland repeated; 'there can be no other kings.
These are their tombs. Do not interrupt.'</p>

<p>'The ancient kings,' Armorel replied, with historic precision.
'These mounds are their tombs. See&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;half a dozen of
them are here. Only kings had barrows raised over them. Did
you expect graves and headstones, Dick Stephenson?'</p>

<p>'Oh, these are barrows, are they?' he replied, in some confusion.
A man of the world does not expect to be caught in
ignorance by the solitary inhabitant of a desert island.</p>

<p>'A long time ago,' Armorel went on, 'these islands formed part
of the mainland. Bryher and Tresco, St. Helen's, Tean, St.
Martin's and St. Mary's, were all joined together, and the road
was only a creek of the sea. Then the sea washed away all the
land between Scilly and the Land's End. They used to call the
place Lyonesse. The kings of Lyonesse were buried on Samson.
Their kingdom is gone, but their graves remain. It is said that
their ghosts have been seen. Dorcas saw them once.'</p>

<p>'I should like to see them very much,' said Roland.</p>

<p>'If you were here at night, we could go out and look for them.
I have been here often after dark looking for them.'</p>

<p>'What did you see?'</p>

<p>She answered like unto the bold Sir Bedivere&mdash;who, perhaps,
was standing on that occasion not far from this hill-top.</p>

<p>'I saw the moonlight on the rocks, and I heard the beating of
the waves.'</p>

<p>Quoth Dick: 'The spook of a king of Lyonesse would be
indeed worth coming out to see.'</p>

<p>Armorel led the way to a barrow, the top of which showed signs
of the spade.</p>

<p>'See!' she said. 'Here is one that has been opened. It was
a long time ago.'</p>

<p>There were the four slabs of stone still in position which formed
the sides of the grave, and the slab which had been its cover lying
close beside.</p>

<p>Armorel looked into the grave. 'They found,' she whispered,
'the bones of the king lying on the stone. But when someone
touched them they turned to dust. There is the dust at your feet
in the grave. The wind cannot bear it away. It may blow the
sand and earth into it, but the dust remains. The rain can turn
it into mud, but it cannot melt it. This is the dust of a king.'</p>

<p>The young men stood beside her silent, awed a little, partly by
the serious look in the girl's face, and partly because, though it
now lay open to the wind and rain, it was really a grave. One
must not laugh beside the grave of a man. The wind lifted Armorel's
long locks and blew them off her white forehead: her eyes were
sad and even solemn. Even the short-sighted Dick saw that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
friend was right: they were soft black eyes, not of the gipsy kind;
and he repented him of a hasty inference. To the artist it seemed
as if here was a princess of Lyonesse mourning over the grave of
her buried king and&mdash;what?&mdash;father&mdash;brother&mdash;cousin&mdash;lover?
Everything, in his imagination, vanished&mdash;except that one figure:
even her clothes were changed for the raiment&mdash;say the court
mourning&mdash;of that vanished realm. And also, like Sir Bedivere,
he heard nothing but the wild water lapping on the crag.</p>

<p>And here followed a thing so strange that the historian hesitates
about putting it down.</p>

<p>Let us remember that it is thirty years, or thereabouts, since
this barrow was laid open; that we may suppose those who opened
it to have had eyes in their heads; that it has been lying open
ever since; and that every visitor&mdash;to be sure there are not many&mdash;who
lands on Samson is bound to climb this hill and visit this open
barrow with its perfect kistvaen. These things borne in mind, it
will seem indeed wonderful that anything in the grave should have
escaped discovery.</p>

<p>Roland Lee, leaning over, began idly to poke about the mould
and dust of the grave with his stick. He was thinking of the girl
and of the romance with which his imagination had already clothed
this lonely spot; he was also thinking of a picture which might be
made of her; he was wondering what excuse he could make for
staying another week at Tregarthen's&mdash;when he was startled by
striking his stick against metal. He knelt down and felt about
with his hands. Then he found something and drew it out, and
arose with the triumph that belongs to an archæologist who picks
up an ancient thing&mdash;say, a rose noble in a newly ploughed field.
The thing which he found was a hoop or ring. It was covered and
encrusted with mould; he rubbed this off with his fingers. Lo! it
was of gold: a hoop of gold as thick as a lady's little finger,
twisted spirally, bent into the form of a circle, the two ends not
joined, but turned back. Pure gold: yellow, soft gold.</p>

<p>'I believe,' he said, gasping, 'that this must be&mdash;it <em>is</em>&mdash;a torque.
I think I have seen something like it in museums. And I've read
of them. It was your king's necklace: it was buried with him:
it lay around the skeleton neck all these thousand years. Take
it, Miss Armorel. It is yours.'</p>

<p>'No! no! Let me look at it. Let me have it in my hands.
It is yours'&mdash;in ignorance of ancient law and the rights of the lord
proprietor&mdash;'it is yours because you found it.'</p>

<p>'Then I will give it to you, because you are the Princess of the
Island.'</p>

<p>She took it with a blush and placed it round her own neck,
bending open the ends and closing them again. It lay there&mdash;the
red, red gold&mdash;as if it belonged to her and had been made for her.</p>

<p>'The buried king is your ancestor,' said Roland. 'It is his
legacy to his descendant. Wear the king's necklace.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>'My luck, as usual,' grumbled Dick, aside. 'Why couldn't I
find a torque and say pretty things?'</p>

<p>'Come,' said Armorel, 'we have seen the barrows. There are
others scattered about&mdash;but this is the best place for them. Now
I will show you the island.'</p>

<p>The hill slopes gently northward till it reaches a headland or
carn of granite boldly projecting. Here it breaks away sharply to
the sea. Armorel climbed lightly up the carn and stood upon the
highest boulder, a pretty figure against the sky. The young men
followed and stood below her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="366" height="600" alt="Armorel climbed lightly up the carn." title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Armorel climbed lightly up the carn.</i></span>
</div>

<p>At their feet the waves broke in white foam (in the calmest
weather the Atlantic surge rolling over the rocks is broken into
foam), a broad sound or channel lay between Samson and the
adjacent island: in the channel half a dozen rocks and islets
showed black and threatening.</p>

<p>'The island across the channel,' said Armorel, 'is Bryher. This
is Bryher Hill, because it faces Bryher Island. Yonder, on Bryher
is Samson Hill, because it faces Samson Island. Bryher is a large
place. There are houses and farms on Bryher, and a church where
they have service every Sunday afternoon. If you were here on
Sunday, you could go in our boat with Peter, Chessun, and me.
Justinian and Dorcas mostly stay at home now, because they are
old.'</p>

<p>'Can anybody stay on the island, then?' asked Roland, quickly.</p>

<p>'Once the doctor came for Justinian's rheumatism, and bad
weather began and he had to stay a week.'</p>

<p>'His other patients meanly took advantage and got well, I
suppose,' said Dick.</p>

<p>'I hope so,' Armorel replied simply.</p>

<p>She turned and looked to the north-east, where lie the eastern
islands, the group between St. Martin's and St. Mary's, a miniature
in little of the greater group. From this point they looked
to the eye of ignorance like one island. Armorel distinguished
them. There were Great and Little Arthur; Ganilly, with his
two hills, like Samson; the Ganninicks and Meneweather, Ragged
Island, and Inisvouls.</p>

<p>'They are not inhabited,' said the girl, pointing to them one by
one; 'but it is pleasant to row about among them in fine weather.
In the old time, when they made kelp, people would go and live
there for weeks together. But they are not cultivated.'</p>

<p>Then she turned northwards, and showed them the long island
of St. Martin's, with its white houses, its church, its gentle hills,
and its white and red daymark on the highest point. Half of
St. Martin's was hidden by Tresco, and more than half of Tresco
by Bryher. Over the downs of Tresco rose the dome of Round
Island, crowned with its white lighthouse. And over Bryher, out
at sea, showed the rent and jagged crest of the great rock
Menovawr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>'You should land on Tresco,' said Armorel. 'There is the
church to see. Oh! it is a most beautiful church. They say that
in Cornwall itself there is hardly any church so fine as Tresco
Church. And then there are the gardens and the lake. Everybody
goes to see the gardens, but they do not walk over the down
to Cromwell's Castle. Yet there is nothing in the islands like
Cromwell's Castle, standing on the Sound, with Shipman's Head
beyond. And you must go out beyond Tresco, to the islands which
we cannot see here&mdash;Tean and St. Helen's, and the rest.'</p>

<p>Then she turned westward. Lying scattered among the bright
waters, whitened by the breeze, there lay before their eyes&mdash;dots
and specks upon the biggest maps, but here great massive rocks
and rugged islets piled with granite, surrounded by ledges and
reefs, cut and carved by winds and flying foam into ragged edges,
bold peaks, and defiant cliffs&mdash;places where all the year round the
seals play and the sea-gulls scream, and, in spring, the puffins lay
their eggs, with the oyster-catchers and the sherewaters, the shags
and the hern. Over all shone the golden sun of September, and
round them all the water leaped and sparkled in the light.</p>

<p>'Those are the Outer Islands.' The girl pointed them out,
her eyes brightening. 'It is among the Outer Islands that I like
best to sail. Look! that great rock with the ledge at foot is Castle
Bryher; that noble rock beyond is Maiden Bower; the rock
farthest out is Scilly. If you were going to stay, we would sail
round Scilly and watch the waves always tearing at his sides. You
cannot see from here, but he is divided by a narrow channel; the
water always rushes through this channel roaring and tearing.
But once we found it calm&mdash;and we got through; only Peter would
never try again. If you were going to stay&mdash;sometimes in
September it is very still&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I did not know,' said Roland, 'that there was anything near
England so wonderful and so lovely.'</p>

<p>'You cannot see the islands in one morning. You cannot see
half of them from this hill. You like them more and more as you
stay longer, and see them every day with a different light and a
different sea.'</p>

<p>'You know them all, I suppose?' Roland asked.</p>

<p>'Oh! every one. If you had sailed among them so often, you
would know them too. There are hundreds, and every one has
got its name. I think I have stood on all, though there are some
on which no one can land, even at low tide and in the calmest
weather. And no one knows what beautiful bays and beaches and
headlands there are hidden away and never seen by anyone. If
you could stay, I would show them to you. But since you
cannot&mdash;&mdash;' She sighed. 'Well, you have not even seen the
whole of Samson yet&mdash;and that is only one of all the rest.'</p>

<p>She leaped lightly from the rocks, and led them southward.</p>

<p>'See!' she said. 'On this hill there are ten great barrows at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
least, every one the tomb of a king&mdash;a king of Lyonesse. And on
the sides of the hill&mdash;they kept the top for the kings&mdash;there are
smaller barrows, I suppose of the princes and princesses. I told
you that the island was a royal burying-ground. At the foot of the
hill&mdash;you can see them&mdash;are some walls which they say are the ruins
of a church; but I suppose that in those days they had no church.'</p>

<p>They left these venerable tombs behind them and descended the
hill. At its foot, between the two hills, there lies a pretty little
bay, circular and fringed with a beach of white sand. If one
wanted a port for Samson, here is the spot, looking straight across
the Atlantic, with Mincarlo lying like a lion couchant on the water
a mile out.</p>

<p>'This is Porth Bay,' said their guide. 'Out there at the end
is Shark Point. There are sharks sometimes, I believe: but I have
never seen them. Now we are going up the southern hill.'</p>

<p>It began with a gentle ascent. There were signs of former
cultivation; stone walls remained, enclosing spaces which once
were fields&mdash;nothing in them now but fern and gorse and bramble
and wild flowers. Half-way up there stood a ruined cottage. The
walls were standing, but the roof was gone and all the woodwork.
The garden-wall remained, but the little garden was overrun with
fern.</p>

<p>'This was my great-great-grandmother's cottage,' said Armorel.
'It was built by her husband. They lived in it for twelve months
after they were married. Then he was drowned, and she came to
live at the farm. See!'&mdash;she showed them in a corner of the garden
a little wizened apple-tree, crouching under the stone wall out of
the reach of the north wind&mdash;'she planted this tree on her wedding-day.
It is too old now to bear fruit; but she is still living, and
her husband has been dead for seventy-five years. I often come to
look at the place, and to wonder how it looked when it was first
inhabited. There were flowers, I suppose, in the garden, when she
was young and happy.'</p>

<p>'There are more ruins,' said Roland.</p>

<p>'Yes, there are other ruins. When all the people except ourselves
went away, these cottages were deserted, and so they fell into
decay. They used to live by smuggling and wrecking, you see, and
when they could no longer do either, they had to go away or starve.'</p>

<p>They stood upon the highest point of Holy Hill, some twenty
feet above the summit of the northern hill, and looked out upon the
Southern Islands.</p>

<p>'There!' said Armorel, with a flush of pride, because the view
here is so different and yet so lovely.</p>

<p>'Here you can see the South Islands. Look! there is Minalto,
which you drifted past yesterday: those are the ledges of White
Island, where you were nearly cast away and lost: there is Annet,
where the sea-birds lay their eggs&mdash;oh! thousands and thousands of
puffins, though now there are not any: you should see them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
spring. That is St. Agnes&mdash;a beautiful island. I should like to
show you Camberdizl and St. Warna's Cove. And there are the
Dogs of Scilly beyond&mdash;they look to be black spots from here. You
should see them close: then you would understand how big they
are and how terrible. There are Gorregan and Daisy, Rosevean and
Rosevear, Crebawethan and Pednathias; and there&mdash;where you see
a little circle of white&mdash;that is Retarrier Ledge. Not long ago
there was a great ship coming slowly up the Channel in
bad weather: she was filled with Germans from New York
going home to spend the money they had saved in America: most
of them had their money with them tied up in bags. Suddenly,
the ship struck on Retarrier. It was ten o'clock in the evening
and a great sea running. For two hours the ship kept bumping on
the rocks: then she began to break up, and they were all drowned&mdash;all
the women and all the children, and most of the men. Some
of them had life-belts on, but they did not know how to tie them,
and so the things only slipped down over their legs and helped to
drown them. The money was found on them. In the old days
the people of the islands would have had it all; but the coastguard
took care of it. There, on the right of Retarrier, is the Bishop's
Rock and lighthouse. In storms, the lighthouse rocks like a tree
in the wind. You ought to sail over to those rocks, if it was only to
see the surf dashing up their sides. But, since you cannot stay&mdash;&mdash;'
Again she sighed.</p>

<p>'These are very interesting islands,' said Dick. 'Especially is
it interesting to consider the consequences of being a native.'</p>

<p>'I should like to stay and sail among them,' said Roland.</p>

<p>'For instance'&mdash;Dick pursued his line of thought&mdash;'in the study
of geography. We who are from the inland parts of Great Britain
must begin by learning the elements, the definitions, the terminology.
Now to a Scilly boy&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A Scillonian,' the girl corrected him. 'We never speak of Scilly
folk.'</p>

<p>'Naturally. To a Scillonian no explanation is needed. He
knows, without being told, the meaning of peninsula, island, bay,
shore, archipelago, current, tide, cape, headland, ocean, lake, road,
harbour, reef, lighthouse, beacon, buoy, sounding&mdash;everything.
He must know also what is meant by a gale of wind, a stiff breeze,
a dead calm. He recognises, by the look of it, a lively sea, a chopping
sea, a heavy sea, a roaring sea, a sulky sea. He knows everything
except a river. That, I suppose, requires very careful
explanation. It was a Scilly youth&mdash;I mean a Scillonian&mdash;who
sat down on the river bank to wait for the water to go by. The
history seems to prove the commercial intercourse which in remote
antiquity took place between Ph&oelig;nicia and the Cassiterides or
Scilly Islands.'</p>

<p>Armorel looked puzzled. 'I did not know that story of a
Scillonian and a river,' she said, coldly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>'Never mind his stories,' said Roland. 'This place is a story
in itself: you are a story: we are all in fairyland.'</p>

<p>'No'&mdash;she shook her head. 'Bryher is the only island in all
Scilly which has any fairies. They call them pixies there. I do
not think that fairies would ever like to come and live on Samson:
because of the graves, you know.'</p>

<p>She led them down the hill along a path worn by her own feet
alone, and brought them out to the level space occupied by the
farm-buildings.</p>

<p>'This is where we live,' she said. 'If you could stay here,
Roland Lee, we could give you a room. We have many empty
rooms'&mdash;she sighed&mdash;'since my father and mother and my brothers
were all drowned. Will you come in?'</p>

<p>She took them into the 'best parlour,' a room which struck a
sudden chill to anyone who entered therein. It was the room
reserved for days of ceremony&mdash;for a wedding, a christening, or a
funeral. Between these events the room was never used. The
furniture presented the aspect common to 'best parlours,' being
formal and awkward. In one corner stood a bookcase with glass
doors, filled with books. Armorel showed them into this apartment,
drew up the blind, opened the window&mdash;there was certainly
a stuffiness in the air&mdash;and looked about the room with evident
pride. Few best parlours, she thought, in the adjacent islands of
St. Mary's, Bryher, Tresco, or even Great Britain itself, could beat
this.</p>

<p>She left them for a few minutes, and came back bearing a tray
on which were a plate of apples, another of biscuits, and a decanter
full of a very black liquid. Hospitality has its rules even on
Samson, whither come so few visitors.</p>

<p>'Will you taste our Scilly apples?' she said. 'These are from
our own orchard, behind the house. You will find them very sweet.'</p>

<p>Roland took one&mdash;as a general rule, this young man would
rather take a dose of medicine than an apple&mdash;and munched it
with avidity. 'A delicious fruit!' he cried. But his friend refused
the proffered gift.</p>

<p>'Then you will take a biscuit, Dick Stephenson? Nothing?
At least, a glass of wine?'</p>

<p>'Never in the morning, thank you.'</p>

<p>'You will, Roland Lee?' She turned, with a look of disappointment,
to the other man, who was so easily pleased and who said
such beautiful things. 'It is my own wine&mdash;I made it myself last
year, of ripe blackberries.'</p>

<p>'Indeed I will! Your own wine? Your own making, Miss
Armorel? Wine of Samson&mdash;the glorious vintage of the blackberry!
In pies and in jam-pots I know the blackberry, but not,
as yet, in decanters. Thank you, thank you!'</p>

<p>He smiled heroically while he held the glass to the light, smelt
it, rolled it gently round. Then he tasted it. 'Sweet,' he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
critically. 'And strong. Clings to the palate. A liqueur wine&mdash;a
curious wine.' He drank it up, and smiled again. 'Your own
making! It is wonderful! No&mdash;not another drop, thank you!'</p>

<p>'Shall I show you?'&mdash;the girl asked, timidly&mdash;'would you like to
see my great-great-grandmother? She is so very old that the people
come all the way from St. Agnes only just to look at her.
Sometimes she answers questions for them, and they think it is
telling their fortunes. She is asleep. But you may talk aloud. You
will not awaken her. She is so very, very old, you know. Consider:
she has been a widow nearly eighty years.'</p>

<p>She led them into the other room, where, in effect, the ancient
dame sat in her hooded chair fast asleep, in cap and bonnet, her
hands, in black mittens, crossed.</p>

<p>'Heavens!' Roland murmured. 'What a face! I must draw
that face! And'&mdash;he looked at the girl bending over the chair
placing a pillow in position&mdash;'and that other. It is wonderful!' he
said aloud. 'This is, indeed, the face of one who has lived a
hundred years. Does she sometimes wake up and talk?'</p>

<p>'In the evening she recovers her memory for awhile and talks&mdash;sometimes
quite nicely, sometimes she rambles.'</p>

<p>'And you have a spinning-wheel in the corner.'</p>

<p>'She likes someone to work at the spinning-wheel while she
talks. Then she thinks it is the old time back again.'</p>

<p>'And there is a violin.'</p>

<p>'I play it in the evening. It keeps her awake, and helps her to
remember. Justinian taught me. He used to play very well
indeed until his fingers grew stiff. I can play a great many tunes,
but it is difficult to learn any new ones. Last summer there were
some ladies at Tregarthen's&mdash;one of them had a most beautiful
voice, and she used to sing in the evening with the window open.
I used to sail across on purpose to land and listen outside. And I
learned a very pretty tune. I would play it to you in the evening
if you were not going away.'</p>

<p>'I am not obliged to go away,' the young man said, with
strangely flushing cheeks.</p>

<p>'Roland!' That was Dick's voice&mdash;but it was unheeded.</p>

<p>'Will you stay here, then?' the girl asked.</p>

<p>'Here in this house? In your house?'</p>

<p>'You can have my brother Emanuel's room. I shall be very
glad if you will stay. And I will show you everything.' She did
not invite the young man called Dick, but this other, the young
man who drank her wine and ate her apple.</p>

<p>'If your&mdash;your&mdash;your guardian&mdash;or your great-great-grandmother
approves.'</p>

<p>'Oh! she will approve. Stay, Roland Lee. We will make you
very happy here. And you don't know what a lot there is to see.'</p>

<p>'Roland!' Again Dick's warning voice.</p>

<p>'A thousand thanks!' he said. 'I will stay.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE ENCHANTED ISLAND</small></h2>


<p>The striking of seven by the most sonorous and musical of clocks
ever heard reminded Roland of the dinner-hour. At seven most
of us are preparing for this function, which civilisation has converted
almost into an act of praise and worship. Some men, he
remembered, were now walking in the direction of the club: some
were dressing: some were making for restaurants: some had
already begun. One naturally associates seven o'clock with the
anticipation of dinner. There are men, it is true, who habitually
take in food at midday and call it dinner: there are also those
who have no dinner at all. He began to realise that he was not,
this evening, going to have any dinner at all. For he was now at
the farmhouse, sitting in the square window with Armorel: he had
gone back to Tregarthen's and returned with his portmanteau and
his painting gear: fortunately he had also taken an abundant lunch
at that establishment. He had become an inhabitant of Samson.
The increased population, therefore, now consisted of seven souls.</p>

<p>In fact, there was no dinner for him. Everybody in Samson
dines at half-past twelve: he had tea with Armorel at half-past
four: after tea they wandered along the shore and stood upon
Shark Point to see the sun set behind Mincarlo, an operation performed
with zeal and despatch, and with great breadth and largeness
of colouring. When the shades of evening began to prevail
they were fain to get home quickly, because there is no path among
the boulders, nor have former inhabitants provided hand-rails for
visitors on the carns. Therefore they retraced their steps to the
farm, and Armorel left him sitting alone in the square window
while she went about some household duties. In the quiet room
the solemn clock told the moments, and there was light enough
left to discern the ghostly figure of the ancient dame sleeping in
her chair. The place was so quiet and so strange that the visitor
presently felt as if he was sitting among ghosts. It is at twilight,
in fact, that the spirits of the past make themselves most readily
felt, if not seen. Now, it was exactly as if he had been in the
place before. He knew, now, why he had been so suddenly and
strangely attracted to Samson. He <i>had been there before</i>&mdash;when,
or under what conditions, he knew not, and did not ask himself.
It is a condition of the mind known to everybody. A touch&mdash;a
word&mdash;a look&mdash;and we are transported back&mdash;how many years ago?
The hills, the rocks, the house, Armorel herself&mdash;all were familiar
to him. The thing was absurd, yet in his mind it was quite clear.
It was so absurd that he thought his mind was wandering, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
arose and went out into the garden. There, the figure-head of the
woman under the tall fuchsia-tree&mdash;the glow from the fire in the
sitting-room fell upon the face through the window&mdash;seemed to
smile upon him as upon an old friend. He went back again and
sat down. Where was Armorel?</p>

<p>This strange familiarity with an unknown place quickly passes,
though it may return. He now began to feel as if, perhaps, he was
making a mistake. He was living on an island, with, practically,
no other companion than a girl of fifteen. Dick, who had become
suddenly grumpy on learning his resolution to stay, might be right.
Well, he would sketch and paint; he would be very careful; not
a word should be said that might disturb the child's tranquillity.
No&mdash;Dick was a fool. He was going to have a day or two&mdash;just a
day or two&mdash;of quiet happiness. The girl was young and beautiful
and innocent. She was also made happy&mdash;she showed that happiness
without an attempt at concealment&mdash;because he was going to
stay. What would follow?</p>

<p>Well&mdash;it was an adventure. One does not ask what is going to
follow on first encountering an adventure. What young man,
besides, sallying forth upon a simple holiday, looks to find himself
upon a desert island with no other companion than a trustful and
admiring maiden of fifteen?</p>

<p>Then Armorel returned and took a chair beside him. He was
a little surprised&mdash;but then, on a desert island nothing happens as
on terra firma&mdash;that she did not ring for lights, and was still not
without some hope of dinner. They took up the thread of talk
about the islands, concerning which Roland Lee perceived that he
would before long know a good deal. Local knowledge is always
interesting; but it does not, except to novelists, possess a marketable
value. One cannot, for instance, at a dinner-party, turn the
conversation on the respective families of St. Agnes and St. Martin's.
He made a mental note that he would presently change the subject
to one of deeper personal interest. Perhaps he could get Armorel
to talk about herself. That would be very much more interesting
than to hear about the three Pipers' Holes of Tresco, White, and
St. Mary's Islands. How did she live&mdash;this girl&mdash;and what did
she do&mdash;and what did she think?</p>

<p>Meantime, while the girl herself was talking of the rocks and
bays, the crags and coves, the white sand and the grey granite, the
seals and the shags, the puffins and the dottrells, she was wondering,
for her part, what manner of man this was&mdash;how he lived,
and what he did, and what he thought. For when man and
woman meet they are clothed and covered up; they are a mystery
each to the other; never, since the Fall, have we been able to
read each other's hearts.</p>

<p>But when the clock struck seven Armorel sprang to her feet, as
one who hath a serious duty to perform, and preparations to make
for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>First she pulled down the blind, and so shut out what was left
of the twilight. The fire had sunk low, but by its light she was
dimly visible. She pushed back the table; she placed two chairs
opposite the old lady, and another chair before the spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>'Something,' said the young man to himself, 'is certainly
going to happen. One can no longer hope for dinner. Family
prayers, perhaps; or the worship of the old lady as an ancestor.
The descendants of the ancient people of Lyonesse no doubt bow
down to the sun and dance to the moon, and pass the children
through the holèd stone, and make Baal fires, and worship their
grandmothers. It will be an interesting function. But, perhaps,
only family prayers.'</p>

<p>Armorel took down the fiddle that hung on the wall and began
to tune it, twanging the strings and drawing the bow across in the
manner which so pleasantly excites the theatre before the music
begins.</p>

<p>'Not family prayers, then,' said the young man, perhaps disappointed.</p>

<p>What did happen, however, was a series of things quite new and
wholly unexpected. Never was known such a desert island.</p>

<p>First of all, the lady of many generations moved uneasily in
her sleep at the twanging of the strings, and her fingers clutched
at her dress as if she was startled by an uneasy dream.</p>

<p>And then the door opened, and a small procession of three
came in. At this point, had the young man been a Roman
Catholic, he would have crossed himself. As he was not, he only
started and murmured, 'As I thought. The worship of the
ancestor! These are the ghosts of the grandfather and the grandmother.
The old lady is a mummy. They are all ghosts&mdash;I shall
presently awake and find myself on my back among the barrows.'</p>

<p>First came an ancient dame, but not so ancient as she of the
great chair. Grey-headed she was, and equipped in a large cap;
wrinkled was her face, and her chin, for lack of teeth, approached
her nose, quite in the ancestral manner. She was followed by an
old man, also grey-headed and grey-bearded, wrinkled of face,
his shoulders bent and twisted with rheumatism, his fingers
gnarled and twisted. These two took the chairs set for them by
Armorel. The third in the procession was a woman already elderly
and with streaks of grey in her hair. She was thin and sharp-faced.
She sat down before the spinning-wheel and began to work,
not as you may now see the amateur, but in the quiet, quick, professional
manner which means business.</p>

<p>The stranger was not quite right in his conjecture. They were
not ancestors. The old man, who had worked on the farm, man
and boy, for nearly seventy years, and now managed it altogether,
was Justinian Tryeth. The old woman was Dorcas, his wife. The
middle-aged woman was their daughter Chessun, who had been
maid on the farm, as her brother Peter had been boy, all her life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever was intended was clearly a daily function, because
each dropped into his own place without hesitation. The old
woman had brought some knitting with her, her daughter picked
up the thread of the spindle, and the old man, taking the tongs,
stimulated the coals into a flame, which he continually nursed and
maintained with new fuel. There was neither lamp nor candle in
the room; the ruddy firelight, rising and falling, played about the
room, warming the drab panels into crimson, sinking into the dark
beams of the joists, flashing among the china in the cupboard,
painting red the Venus's-fingers in the cabinet, and throwing
strange lights and shadows upon the aged lady in the chair. Was
she really alive? Was she, after all, only a mummy?</p>

<p>Roland looked on breathless. What was to be done next?
Time had gone back eighty years&mdash;a hundred and eighty years&mdash;any
number of years. As they sat here in the firelight with the
spinning-wheel, the old serving-people with their mistress, without
lamp or candle, so they sat in the generations long gone by. And
again that curious feeling fell upon him that he had seen it all
before. Yet he could not remember what was to be done next.
Armorel, the tuning complete, turned with a look of inquiry to
the old man.</p>

<p>'"Singleton's Slip,"' he commanded with the authority of a
professor.</p>

<p>The girl began to play this old tune. Perhaps you remember
the style of the fiddler&mdash;he is getting scarce now&mdash;who used to sit
in the corner and play the hornpipe for the sailors in the days
when every sailor could dance the hornpipe. Perhaps you do not
remember that fiddler and his style. That is your misfortune.
For there was a noble freedom in the handling of his bow, and the
interpretation of his melodies was bold and original. He poured
into the music all the spirit it was capable of containing, and drew
out of his hearers every emotion that each particular tune was
able to draw. Because you see tunes have their limitations. You
cannot strike every chord in the human heart with a simple hornpipe.
This sailor's best friend, however, did all that could be
done. And always conscientious, if you please, never allowing
his playing to become slovenly or to lack spirit.</p>

<p>Armorel played after the manner of this old fiddler, standing
up to her work in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>'Singleton's Slip' is a ditty which was formerly much admired
by those who danced the hey, the jig, or the simple country dance:
it was also much played by the pipe and tabor upon the village
green; it accompanied the bear when he carried the pole; it
assisted those who danced on stilts; and it lent spirit to those who
frolicked in the morrice. Charles II. knew it; Tom D'Urfey
wrote words to it, I believe, but I have not yet found them in his
collection; Rochester must certainly have danced to it. Armorel
played it; first cheerfully and loudly, as if to arouse the spirits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
those who listened, to remind them that legs may be shaken to
this tune, and that ladies may be, and should be, when this tune
begins, taken to their places and presently handed round and down
the middle. Then she played it trippingly, as if they were actually
all dancing. Then she played it tenderly&mdash;there is, if you come
to think of it, a good deal of possible tenderness in the air&mdash;and,
lastly, she played it joyfully, yet softly. How had she learned all
these modes and moods?</p>

<p>While she played the old man listened critically, nodding
his head and beating the time. Then, fired with memory, he bent
his arms and worked his fingers as if they held the fiddle and the
bow. And he threw back his head and thrust out his leg and
leaned sideways, just like that jolly fiddler of whom we have just
been reminded. Such, my friends, is the power of music.</p>

<p>After a little while Justinian stopped this imaginary performance,
and sitting forward yielded himself wholly to the influence of the
tune, cracking his fingers over his head and beating time with one
foot, just as you may see the old villager in the old coloured prints&mdash;no
villager in these days of bad beer ever cracks his fingers or
shows any external signs of joyful emotion. As for the two serving-women,
they reminded the spectator of the supers on the stage
who march when they are told to march, sit down to feast when
they are ordered, and swell a procession for a funeral or a festival,
all with unmoved countenance, showing a philosophy so great
that the triumph of victory or the disaster of defeat finds them
equally calm and self-contained&mdash;that is to say, the two women
showed no sense at all of being pleased or moved by 'Singleton's
Slip.' They went on&mdash;one with her knitting and the other with
her spinning.</p>

<p>As for the ancient lady, however, when the music began she
straightened herself, sat upright, and opened her eyes. Then
Chessun hastened to adjust her bonnet: if ladies sleep in their
bonnets, these adornments have a tendency to fall out of the
perpendicular. Heaven forbid that we should gaze upon Ursula
Rosevean with her bonnet tilted, like a lady in a van coming home to
Wapping from Fairlop Fair! This done, the venerable dame looked
about her with eyes curiously bright and keen. Then she began
to beat time with her fingers; and then she began to talk; but&mdash;and
this added to the strangeness of the whole business&mdash;nobody
seemed to regard what she said. It was much as if the Oracle of
Delphi were pouring out the most valuable prophecies and none of
her attendants paid any heed. 'If,' thought the young man,
'I were to take down her words, they would be a Message.' And
what with the voice of the Oracle, the spirited fiddling, the firelight
dancing about the room, the old man snapping his fingers,
and perhaps some physical exhaustion following on the absence of
dinner, the young man felt as if the music had got into his head;
he wanted to get up and dance with Armorel round and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the room; he would not have marvelled had Dorcas and Justinian
bidden him lead out Chessun and so take hands, round twice, down
the middle and back again, set and turn single&mdash;where had he
learnt these phrases and terms of the old country dance?
Nowhere; they belonged to the place and to the music and to the
time&mdash;and that was at least a hundred and eighty years back.</p>

<p>The fiddle stopped. Armorel held it down, and looked again
at her master.</p>

<p>''Tis well played,' he said. 'A moving piece. Now, "Prince
Rupert's March."'</p>

<p>She nodded, and began another tune. This is a piece which
may be played many ways. First, to those who understand it
rightly, it indicates the tramp of an army, the riding of the cavalry,
the jingling of sabres. Next, it may serve for a battle-piece, and
you shall hear between the bars the charge of the horse and the
clashing of the steel. Or, it may be played as a triumphal march after
victory; or, again, as a country dance, in which a stately dignity
takes the place of youthful mirth and merriment. At such a dance,
to the tune of 'Prince Rupert's March,' the elders themselves&mdash;yea,
the Justice of Peace, the Vicar, the Mayor and Aldermen, and
the Head-borough himself&mdash;may stand up in line.</p>

<p>And now Roland became conscious of the old lady's words;
he heard them clear and distinct, and as she talked the firelight
fell upon her eyes, and she seemed to be gazing fixedly upon the
stranger.</p>

<p>'When the "Princess Augusta," East Indiaman, struck upon
the Castinicks in the middle of the night, she went to pieces in an
hour&mdash;any vessel would. They said she was wrecked by the people
of Samson, who tied a ship's lantern between the horns of a cow.
But it was never proved. There are other islands in Scilly, and
other islanders, if you talk of wrecking. Some of the dead bodies
were washed ashore, and a good part of the cargo, so that there was
something for everybody; a finer wreck never came to the islands.
What! If a ship is bound to be wrecked, better that she should
strike on British rocks and cast her cargo ashore for the king's
subjects. Better the rocks of Scilly than the rocks of France.
What the sea casts up belongs to the people who find it. That is
just. But you must not rob the living. No. That is a great
crime. 'Twas in the year '13. When Emanuel Rosevean, my
father-in-law, rescued the passenger who was lying senseless lashed
to a spar, he should not have taken the bag that was hanging round
his neck. That was not well done. He should have given the
man his bag again. He stood here before he went away. "You
have saved my life," he said. "I had all my treasure in a bag tied
about my neck. If I had brought that safe ashore I could have
offered you something worth your acceptance. But I have nothing.
I begin the world again." Emanuel heard him say this, and he
let him go. But the bag was in his box. He kept the bag. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
soon the wrath of the Lord fell upon the house, and His Hand has
been heavy upon us ever since. No luck for us&mdash;nor shall be any
till we find the man and give him back his bag of treasure.'</p>

<p>She went on repeating this story with small variations and
additions. But Roland was now listening again to the fiddle.</p>

<p>Armorel stopped again.</p>

<p>'"Dissembling Love,"' said her master.</p>

<p>She began that tune obediently.</p>

<p>The stranger within the gates seemed compelled to listen. His
brain reeled; the old woman fascinated him. The words which he
had heard had been few, but now he seemed to see, standing before
the fire, his hair powdered, and in black silk stockings and shoes
with steel buckles, the man who had been saved and robbed shaking
hands with the man who had saved and robbed him. Oh! it was
quite clear; he had seen it all before; he remembered it. This
time he heard nothing of the tune.</p>

<p>'My husband, Methusalem, my dear husband, with his only
brother, began to pay for that wickedness. They were capsized
crossing to St. Mary's, and drowned. If I had thought what was
going to happen I would have taken the bag and walked through all
England looking for him until I had found him. Yes&mdash;if it took
me fifty years. But I knew nothing. I thought our happiness
would last for ever. Five-and-twenty years after, my son,
Emanuel, was cast away in the Bristol Channel piloting a vessel.
They struck on Steep Holm in a fog. And your own father,
Armorel, was drowned with his wife and three boys on their way
home from a wedding-feast at St. Agnes.'</p>

<p>Here her voice dropped, and Roland heard the concluding bars
of 'Dissembling Love,' which Armorel was playing with quite uncommon
tenderness.</p>

<p>When she stopped, Justinian gave her no rest. '"Blue
Petticoats,"' he commanded.</p>

<p>Armorel again obeyed.</p>

<p>Then the old lady went back in memory to the days of her girlhood&mdash;now
so long ago. Nowhere now can one find an old lady
who will tell of her girlish days when the century was not yet
arrived at the age of ten.</p>

<p>'We shall dance to-night,' she said, 'on Bryher Green. My
boy will be there. We shall dance together. John Tryeth from
Samson will play his fiddle. We shall dance "Prince Rupert's
March" and "Blue Petticoats" and "Dissembling Love." The
Ensign from the garrison is coming and the Deputy Commissary.
They will drink my health. But they shall not have me for
partner. My boy will be there&mdash;my own boy&mdash;the handsomest man
on all the islands, though he is so black. That's the Spaniard in
him. His mother was a Mureno&mdash;Honor Mureno, the last of the
Murenos. He has got the old Spaniard's sword still. It's the
Spanish blood. It gives my boy his black eyes and his black hair;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
it makes his cheeks swarthy; and it makes him proud and hot-tempered.
I like a man to be quick and proud if he's strong and
brave as well. When I have sons, the Lord make them all like
their father!'</p>

<p>So she went on talking of her lover.</p>

<p>Armorel stopped and looked again at her master.</p>

<p>'"The Chirping of the Lark,"' he said.</p>

<p>Armorel began this tune. It is of an artificial character, lending
itself less readily than the rest to emotion; the composer called it
'The Chirping of the Lark' because he wanted a title: it resembles
the song of that warbler in no single particular. But it changed the
old lady's current of thought.</p>

<p>'This long war,' she said, looking round cheerfully, 'will be the
making of the islands if it lasts. Never was there so much money
about: we roll in money: the women have all got silks and satins:
the men drink port wine and the finest French brandy, which they
run over for themselves: the merchantmen put into the road, and
the sailors spend their money at the port. Why shouldn't we go
on fighting the French until they haven't a ship left afloat? My
man made the run last week, and hid the cargo&mdash;I know where.
I shall help him to carry the kegs across to the garrison, where they
want brandy badly. A fine run and a good day's work!'</p>

<p>She looked around with a jubilant countenance. Then another
memory seized her, and the light left her eyes.</p>

<p>'Better be drowned yourself than marry a man who is going to
be drowned! Better not marry at all than lose your husband six
months afterwards. It is long ago, now, Armorel. Time goes on&mdash;one
can remember. He would be very old now&mdash;yes&mdash;very old.
Sometimes I see him still. But he has not grown old where he is
staying. That is bad for me, because he liked young women, not
old women. Men mostly do. They are so made, even the oldest
of them. Perhaps the old women, when they rise again, are made
young again, so that their lovers may love them still.'</p>

<p>The clock struck half-past eight. Armorel stopped playing and
the old lady stopped talking at the same moment. Her eyes closed,
her head fell forward, she became comatose.</p>

<p>Then the two serving-women got up and helped her, or carried her,
out of the room to her bedroom behind. And the old man arose, and
without so much as a good-night hobbled away to his own cottage.</p>

<p>'She will go to bed now,' said Armorel. 'Chessun will take in
her broth and her wine, and she will sleep all night.'</p>

<p>'Do you have this performance every night?'</p>

<p>'Yes; the playing seems to put life and heart into her. All
the morning she dozes, or if she wakes she is not often able to
talk; but in the evening, when we sit around the fire just as they
used to sit in the old days, without candles&mdash;because my people
were poor and candles were dear&mdash;and when Chessun spins and I
play&mdash;she revives and sits up and talks, as you have seen her.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes. It is rather ghostly.'</p>

<p>'Justinian used to play&mdash;oh! he could play very well indeed.'</p>

<p>'Not so well as you.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;much better&mdash;and he knows hundreds of tunes. But
his fingers became stiff with rheumatism, and, as he had put off
teaching Peter until it was too late, he taught me. That is all.'</p>

<p>'I think you play wonderfully well. Do you play nothing but
old tunes?'</p>

<p>'I only know what I have learned. There is that song which
I heard the lady sing last year&mdash;I don't know what it is called.
Tell me if you like it.'</p>

<p>She struck the strings again and played a song full of life and
spirit, of tenderness and fond memory&mdash;a bright, sparkling song&mdash;which
wanted no words.</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Roland, 'you are really wonderful. You are
playing the "Kerry Dance."'</p>

<p>She laughed and layed down the violin.</p>

<p>'We must not have any more playing to-night. Do you really
like to hear me play? You look as if you did.'</p>

<p>'It is wonderful,' he replied. 'I could listen all night. But
if there is to be no more music, shall we look outside?'</p>

<p>If there were no light in the house the ship's lantern was
hanging up, with one of those big ship's candles in it which are of
such noble dimensions, and of generosity so unbounded in the
matter of tallow. There was no moon; but the sky was clear and
the sea could be seen by the light of the stars, and the revolving
lights of Bishop's Rock and St. Agnes flashed across the water.</p>

<p>The young man shivered.</p>

<p>'We are in fairyland,' he said. 'It is a charmed island.
Nothing is real. Armorel, your name should be Titania. How
have you made me hear and believe all these things? How do
you contrive your sorceries? Are you an enchantress? Confess&mdash;you
cannot, in sober truth, play those tunes; the old lady is in
reality only a phantom, called into visible shape by your incantations?
But you are a benevolent witch&mdash;you will not turn me into
a pig?'</p>

<p>'I do not understand. There have been no sorceries. There
are no witches left on the Scilly Islands. Formerly there were
many. Dorcas knows about them. I do not know what was the
good of them.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you are quite real, after all. It is only strange and
incomprehensible.'</p>

<p>'It is a fine night. To-morrow it will be a fine day with a
gentle breeze. We will go sailing among the Outer Islands.'</p>

<p>'The air is heavy with perfume. What is it? Surely an enchanted
land!'</p>

<p>'It is the scent of the lemon-verbena tree&mdash;see, here is a sprig.
It is very sweet.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>'How silent it is here! Night after night never to hear a
sound.'</p>

<p>'Nothing but the sound of the waves. They never cease.
Listen&mdash;it is a calm night. But you can hear them lapping on the
beach.'</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when they returned to the house, they found
candles lighted and supper spread. A substantial supper, such
as was owed to a man who had had no dinner. There was cold roast
fowl and ham; there was a lettuce-salad and a goodly cheese.
And there was the unexpected and grateful sight of a 'Brown
George,' with a most delectable ball of white froth at the top.
Also, Roland remarked the presence of the decanter containing the
blackberry wine.</p>

<p>'Now you shall have some supper.' Armorel assumed the
head of the table and took up the carving-knife. 'No,
thank you&mdash;I can carve very well. Besides, you are our
visitor, and it is a pleasure to carve for you. Will you have a
wing or a leg? Do you like your ham thin? Not too thin? Oh,
how hungry you must be! That is ale&mdash;home-brewed ale: will
you take some? or would you prefer a glass of the blackberry
wine? No?&mdash;help yourself.'</p>

<p>'The beer for me,' said Roland. He filled and drank a tumbler
of the beverage dear to every right-minded Briton. It was strong
and generous, with flakes of hop floating in it like the bee's-wing
in port. 'This is splendid beer,' he said. 'I do not remember
that I ever tasted such beer as this. It is humming ale&mdash;October
ale&mdash;stingo. No wonder our forefathers fought so well when they
had such beer as this to fight upon!'</p>

<p>'Peter is proud of his home-brewed.'</p>

<p>'Do you make everything for yourselves? Is Samson sufficient
for all the needs of the islanders? This beer is the beer of Samson&mdash;strong
and mighty. My hair is growing long already&mdash;and
curly.'</p>

<p>'We make all we can. There are no shops, you see, on Samson.
We bake our own bread: we brew our own beer: we make our
own butter: we even spin our own linen.'</p>

<p>'And you make your own wine, Armorel.' He called her
naturally by her Christian name. You could not call such a girl
'Miss Armorel' or 'Miss Rosevean.' 'It is a wonderful island!'</p>

<p>After supper they sat by the fireside, and, by permission, he
smoked his pipe.</p>

<p>Then, everybody else on the island being in bed and asleep,
they talked. The young man had his way. That is to say, he
encouraged the girl to talk about herself. He led her on: he had
a soft voice, soft eyes, and a general manner of sympathy which
surprised confidence.</p>

<p>She began, timidly at first, to talk about herself, yet with
feminine reservation. No woman will ever talk about herself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the way which delights young men. But she told him all he asked:
her simple lonely life&mdash;how she arose early in the morning, how
she roamed about the island and sang aloud with none to hear her
but the sea-gulls and the shags.</p>

<p>'Do you never draw?' he asked.</p>

<p>She had tried to draw, but there was no one to help her.</p>

<p>'Do you read?'</p>

<p>No, she seldom read. In the best parlour there was a bookcase
full of books, but she never looked at them. As for the old lady
and Dorcas, they had never learned to read. She had been at
school over at St. Mary's, till she was thirteen, but she hardly
cared to read.</p>

<p>'And the newspapers&mdash;do you ever read them?'</p>

<p>She never read them. She knew nothing that went on.</p>

<p>As for her ambitions and her hopes&mdash;if he could get at them.
Fond youth!&mdash;as if a girl would ever tell her ambitions! But
Armorel, apparently, had none to tell. She lived in the present;
it was joy enough for her to wander in the soft warm air of her
island home, upon the hills and round the coast, to cruise among
the rocks while the breeze filled out the sail and the sparkling
water leaped above the bow.</p>

<p>So far she told: nay, she hid nothing, because there was
nothing to hide. She told no more because, as yet, her ambitions
and her dreams of the future had no shape: they were vague and
misty&mdash;she was only aware of their existence when restlessness
seized her and impelled her to get up and run over the hills to
Porth Bay and back again.</p>

<p>But at night, when she went to bed, she experienced quite a
new and disquieting sensation. It showed at least that she was no
longer a child, but already on the threshold of womanhood. With
blushing cheek and beating heart she remembered that for an hour
and more she had been talking about nothing but herself! What
would Mr. Roland Lee think of a girl who could waste his time in
talking about nothing but herself?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE FLOWER-FARM</small></h2>


<p>Roland, startled out of sleep by the sudden feeling of danger
which always seizes us in a strange bed&mdash;except a bed at an inn&mdash;sat
up and looked around him. His room was small and low and
simply furnished. He was lying on a feather bed of the old-fashioned
kind; the bedstead was of wood, but without curtains.
He presently remembered where he was: on Samson Island&mdash;the
guest of a child, a girl of fifteen.</p>

<p>He sprang out of bed and threw open the window. His room
was over the porch. The fragrance of the lemon-verbena tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
arose like steam from a haystack, and filled his chamber. Below
him, and beyond the garden, the geese waddled on the green, the
ducks splashed in the pond, and in the farmyard Peter walked
about slowly, carrying a pitchfork in his hands, but, apparently,
for amusement rather than use, as if it had been a court sword.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was half-past seven. At this time
in London he would have been still in the first long slumber of the
night. Now he was eager to be up and dressed, if only for a
better understanding of the situation. To be the guest of a child
has the freshness of novelty; but it is a situation which might lead
to complications. Suppose a guardian, or a lawyer, or a cousin of
some kind were to cross over in a boat and ask what he was doing
there. And suppose he had no better reply than the plain truth&mdash;that
this young lady had been so good as to invite him. Would a
man go down to stay at a country house on the simple invitation
of a school-girl? At the same time, this girl appeared to be the
mistress of the establishment. There was an ancient lady&mdash;too old
for superintendence&mdash;and there were servants. Well, if no guardian
challenged his presence, why, then, for a single day&mdash;he must not
stay more&mdash;it surely mattered little. The girl was but a child.
Yet he must not stay longer. Perhaps they were not too well off:
he must not be a burden. And, again, though the girl invited him
to stay she named no limit of time. She did not invite him to
stay, for a week or for a fortnight. Perhaps she expected him to
go away that very morning.</p>

<p>He proceeded&mdash;with somewhat thoughtful countenance, considering
these things&mdash;to dress, paying as much attention to his
personal appearance as a young man should, and an old man must.
It is the privilege of middle-aged men to go slovenly if they please:
no one regardeth him of middle age. While their locks are turning
grey and their children are growing up they are in the thick of the
day's work, and they may disregard, if they choose, the mysteries
of the toilette. Apollo, however, must be as jealous about his
apparel and adornment as the Graces themselves, who are always
represented at the moment before the choice is made. A velvet
jacket and a white waistcoat are trifles in themselves, but they
become a youthful figure and a face which has finely-cut features
and is decorated with a promising silky beard, pointed withal, and
the brown shading of a young moustache. Besides, he who is an
artist thinks more than other young men about such things.
Dress, to him, as to a woman, becomes costume. Colour has to be
considered; such picturesqueness as is possible in modern fashion
is aimed at; the artistic craving for fitness and beauty must be
satisfied. Roland did what he could: and with his velvet coat, a
clean white waistcoat, a crimson scarf, a good figure, and a handsome
face, he was as handsome a youth of twenty-one as one is
likely to find anywhere.</p>

<p>Again, as he opened his door and began to descend the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
stairs, there came over him that curious feeling of having been in the
place before. He had felt it in the evening when Armorel played
'Dissembling Love.' Now he felt it again. And when he stood in
the porch he seemed to remember standing there once&mdash;long ago,
long ago&mdash;but how long he could not tell; nor, as happened to him
before, could he remember what had happened on that occasion.</p>

<p>Armorel herself was in the garden looking for some flowers for
the breakfast-table. She greeted him with a smile of welcome
and a friendly grasp of the hand. There was also a look of
kindly solicitude on her face which would have suited a châtelaine
of forty years. Had he slept well? Had he really been provided
with everything he wanted? Was there anything at all lacking?
If so, would he speak to Chessun? Breakfast, she said, leaving
him in the garden, would be served in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Would he speak to Chessun? Then, it seemed as if she meant
him to stay another night. What should he do?</p>

<p>Then Armorel came back.</p>

<p>'Breakfast is quite ready,' she said. 'Come in, Roland Lee.
It is a beautiful morning. There is a fresh breeze and a smooth
sea. We can go anywhere this morning. I have spoken to Peter,
and he will be ready to go with us in an hour or so. I think
we may even get out to Scilly and Maiden Bower.'</p>

<p>Yes; the morning was bright and the sky was clear. In the
golden sunshine of September the islets across the water showed
like creations of a poet's dream.</p>

<p>Roland drew a deep breath of admiration. 'Everybody,' he
said, 'ought to come to Scilly and to stay a long time.'</p>

<p>He turned from the view to the girl beside him. She had
changed her blue flannel dress for a daintier and a prettier costume&mdash;think
not that there are no shops at Hugh Town&mdash;of grey nun's
cloth, daintily embroidered in front. Still at her throat she wore
a red flower, and round her neck clung the golden torque found
in the old king's grave. Her dark eyes glowed: her lips were
parted in a smile: her cheek showed the dewy bloom that some
girls, fortunate above their sisters, can exhibit when they first
appear in the morning: her long tresses were now tied up and
confined; she looked as if she had just stepped forth from her
chamber, fresh from her sleep. No one certainly could have
guessed that she had been up since six; nor that the fish which
had been hissing in the frying-pan, and were now lying meekly
side by side in a dish on the breakfast-table, were of her own
catching. An hour's sitting in the boat off Samson Ledge with
hook and line had procured this splendid contribution to the morning
banquet. Fish fragrant with the salt sea: fish that had not
been packed tight in boxes, nor travelled in railway trains, nor
been slapped about on counters, nor been packed in ice; fish that
can never lie on a London table&mdash;these were set out before Roland's
hungry gaze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancient dame did not appear. The two breakfasted, as
they had supped, together. I do not know how or where Armorel
learned the art and practice of hospitality, but certainly she showed
a true feeling in the matter of feeding&mdash;especially at breakfast.
First, the table was decorated with the autumn leaves of the
bramble&mdash;crimson, yellow, purple&mdash;few, indeed, know how
beautiful a table may be made when decorated with these leaves.
There were also a few late flowers from the garden; but not many.
The coffee was strong, the milk hot and thick, the bread and butter
home-made, like the beer of yester eve: the ham was cured by
Chessun: the eggs were collected by Armorel: she had also with
her own hands made the jam and the cake.</p>

<p>Armorel sat behind the cups with as much ease as if she had
been accustomed from infancy to entertain young gentlemen at
breakfast. She was serious over her task, and poured out the
coffee as if it was something precious, not to be wasted or carelessly
administered, which is the spirit in which all good food should be
approached. She did not ask any questions, nor did she talk
much during the banquet. Perhaps she had an instinctive perception
of the great truth that breakfast, which is taken at the
beginning of the day&mdash;the sacred day, with all its possibilities and
its chances of what may happen; the fateful day, which alone and
unaided may change the whole course and current of a life&mdash;should
be approached with a becoming gravity. At breakfast the man
fortifies himself before he goes forth to work. But he has the
work before him. In the evening it is done: he has passed through
the dangers of the day: he still lives: he has received no hurt:
he has, we hope, prospered in his honest handiwork: he may
laugh and rejoice. But at breakfast we should be serious.</p>

<p>'What will you do,' asked Armorel, breakfast completed, 'until
Peter is ready? He has got some work, you know, before he can
come out.'</p>

<p>'I should like first,' he said, 'to see your flower-farm, if I may.'</p>

<p>'If you please. But there is nothing to see at this time of the
year. You must not think we grow flowers all the year round.
If you were here in February, you would see the fields covered
with beautiful flowers&mdash;iris, anemone, jonquil, narcissus, and daffodil.
They are very pretty then, and the air is sweet with their scent.
But now the fields are quite bare.'</p>

<p>'I should like to see them, however.'</p>

<p>'I will show them to you. It is a great happiness to the
islands,' said Armorel, gravely, 'that we have found out the flower-farming.
Everybody was very poor before. All the old ways of
living were gone, you see. A long time ago the people had wrecks
every winter&mdash;the sea cast up quantities of things which they could
sell, or they went out in boats and took the things out of the hold
when the ship was on the rocks. And then they were all smugglers:
the Scillonians used to run over to France openly, day and night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with no one to stop them. And they used to carry fruit and vegetables
out to the homeward-bound ships in the Channel. And then
they were pilots as well. Some of the men used to make as much
as two hundred pounds a year as pilots. My grandfathers were all
pilots. They were smugglers too; and they had this farm and
grew vegetables for the ships. Then the Government built the
lighthouses, and there were no more wrecks; and the Preventive
Service came and stopped the smuggling; and since the steamers
took the place of the sailing-ships no vessels put in here, and there
are no more pilots wanted. So, you see, it was as if nothing was
left at all.'</p>

<p>'It does seem rough on the people.'</p>

<p>'First they tried kelp-making. They collected the sea-weed
and put it in a kiln or furnace, and made a fire under it. I can
show you some of the old furnaces still. But that came to an end.
Then they tried a fishing company; but I believe it did not pay.
And then they began to build ships; but I suppose other people
could build them better. So that came to an end too. And for
some time I do not know how all the people lived. As for the
farms, they could never grow enough for the islands. Then a
great many of the people went away. They had to go, or they
would have starved. Some went to England, and some to America,
and some to Australia. All the families went away from Samson,
one by one, until at last there were none left but ourselves and
Justinian. On Bryher and St. Martin's they became fishermen,
but not here. As for Justinian, he sent away all his boys except
Peter. Oh! they have done very well&mdash;splendidly. One is a
coastguard, and one is bo's'n in the Queen's Navy. One is captain
of a steamer trading between Philadelphia and Cuba, and one is
actually chief steward on a great Pacific liner! Justinian is very
proud of him.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, yes,' said Roland, 'with reason.'</p>

<p>'The Scillonians,' the girl continued, proudly, 'all get on very
well wherever they go. They are honest, you see, as well as clever.'</p>

<p>'And the flower-farming?'</p>

<p>'Somebody discovered that the early spring flowers, which begin
here in January, could be carried to London and sold quite fresh.
And then everybody began to plant bulbs. That is all. We have
had a farm of some kind here for I do not know how many generations.'</p>

<p>'Since the time,' Roland suggested, 'when, in consequence of
the separation of Scilly from the mainland and the disappearance
of Lyonesse, the royal family found themselves left in Samson.'</p>

<p>She laughed. 'Well, all these stone inclosures on the hill
belonged to our farm. We grew things and ate them, I suppose.
Perhaps we sold them. But we were then poor, I know, and now
we have no more trouble.'</p>

<p>Beside and behind the farmhouse on the slope of the hill they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
came upon a series of little fields following one after the other.
They were quite small&mdash;some mere patches, none larger than a
garden of ordinary size, and they were all enclosed and shut in by
high hedges, so that they looked like largish boxes with the lids
off. Some of the hedges were of elm, growing thick and close;
some of escallonia, with its red flowers; some of veronica, its
purple blossom like heads of bulrush; some of the service-tree; and
some, but not many, of tamarisk, its pink bunches of blossom all
displayed at this time of the year. But the fields were now brown
and bare, and had nothing at all growing in them, except a few
patches of gladiolus, now dying. Beyond these fields, however,
there were others of larger area, with ruder hedges formed by laths,
reeds, wooden palings, and stone walls. These were inclosed, and
partly sheltered for the growth of vegetables.</p>

<p>'These are our fields,' said Armorel. 'At this time of the year
there is nothing to show you. Our harvest begins in January, and
lasts till May; but February and March are our best months. See&mdash;there
is Peter, with a young man from Bryher, planting bulbs for
next year: they are taken up every three years and replanted.'</p>

<p>Peter, in fact, was at work. He was superintending&mdash;a form
of work which he found to suit him best&mdash;while the young man
from Bryher, who looked more than half sailor, with a broad, long-handled
spade, was leisurely turning over the light sandy soil and
laying in the bulbs side by side out of a great basket.</p>

<p>'It seems an easy form of agriculture,' said Roland.</p>

<p>'It is not hard. There is nothing to do after this until the
flowers are picked. But sometimes a cold wind will come down
from the north and will kill a whole field full of blossoms&mdash;in
spite of all our hedges. That is a terrible loss. When everything
goes well, we cut the flowers, pack them in boxes, carry them over
to the port, and next morning they are sold in London&mdash;oh! and
all over the country, in every big town.'</p>

<p>'I shall never again behold a daffodil in February,' said Roland,
'without thinking of Samson. You have lent a new association
to the spring flowers. Henceforth they will bring back this
glorious view of sea and islands, grey and black rocks, the splendid
sunshine and the fresh breeze&mdash;and,' he added, with a winning
smile and deferential eyes, 'the Lady of Lyonesse.'</p>

<p>Armorel laughed. It was very nice to be called the Lady of
Lyonesse&mdash;nobody before had ever called her anything except plain
Armorel. And it was quite a new experience to have a young
gentleman treating her with deference as well as compliment.</p>

<p>At the back of the house was an orchard, through which they
presently passed. Like the flower-fields, it was protected by a
high hedge. But the apple-trees looked like the olives of Provence:
every one seemed in the last decay of age. They were twisted and
dwarfish; the branches grew in queer angles and elbows, as if
they were crouching down out of reach of the north wind; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
trunks were bent, and, which completed their resemblance to the
olive, all alike were covered and clothed with a thick grey lichen,
clinging to every bough like a glove, and hanging like a fringe. If
you tear it off, the tree begins to shiver and shake, though on
Samson it is never cold.</p>

<p>'Let us sit down,' said Roland, 'in this secluded spot and talk.
Have I your leave, Armorel, to&mdash;&mdash; Thank you.' He filled and
lit his briar-root, and lay back on the warm bank, gazing upwards
at the blue sky through the leaves and the twisted branches of an
aged apple-tree.</p>

<p>'It is good to be here. Do you know how very, very good it
was of you to ask me, Armorel? And do you know how very,
very rash it was?'</p>

<p>The girl, who showed her youth and inexperience in many little
ways, regarded him with admiration unconcealed. Certainly, he
was a personable young man, even picturesque; when his beard
should be a little longer, when his moustache should be a little
stronger, he might be able to pass for Charles I. idealised, and in
early manhood, when as yet he had not begun to dissimulate.</p>

<p>'I was so glad when you promised to stay,' she replied, truthfully.</p>

<p>'Again, it is most good of you to say so. But, Armorel, a
dreadful misgiving has possessed me. Does your&mdash;does the Ancestress
approve of the invitation?'</p>

<p>Armorel laughed. 'Why,' she said, 'we never consult her
about anything. She is too old, you know.'</p>

<p>'Was nobody consulted at all? Did you ask me here all out
of your own head, as the children say?'</p>

<p>'Why not? There is nobody to consult. Why should I not
ask you?'</p>

<p>'It was very good of you&mdash;only&mdash;well&mdash;you are younger than
most ladies who invite people to their house.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;but I asked you,' she replied, with a little irritation,
'and you said you would come. You asked if anybody could stay
on the island.'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course.' He did not explain that at first he thought
the place was a lodging-house. The mistake was not unnatural;
but he could not explain. 'I ought to have known,' he said.
'You are the Queen of Samson, as well as a Princess in Lyonesse.
I beg your Majesty to forgive the ignorance of a traveller from
foreign parts.'</p>

<p>'Justinian and Peter manage the farm. Dorcas and Chessun
manage the house. There is no one to ask,' she added, simply,
'what I am doing.'</p>

<p>She said this with a touch of sadness.</p>

<p>'Have you no relations&mdash;cousins&mdash;nobody?'</p>

<p>'I have some far-off cousins. They live in London, I believe.
One of them went away&mdash;a long, long time ago, in the Great War&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
became a purser in the Navy. After that he was purveyor
for the Fleet, and was made a knight. He was my grandfather's
cousin, so I suppose he is dead by this time, but I dare say he has
left children.'</p>

<p>'You are very lonely, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'I had three brothers; but they were all drowned&mdash;father,
mother, three brothers, all drowned together coming from St.
Agnes. That was ten years ago, when I was only a little girl and
did not know what it meant. All our misfortunes, my great-great-grandmother
says, are due to the wickedness of her husband's
father, who took a bag of treasure from the neck of a passenger
rescued from a wreck. You heard her last night. Do you think
that God would drown my innocent brothers and my innocent
father and mother all on the same day, because, eighty years ago,
that wicked thing was done?'</p>

<p>'No, Armorel. I can believe a great deal, but that I cannot
believe.'</p>

<p>'And so, you see, I am quite alone. Why should I not invite
you to stay here?'</p>

<p>'There is not, in reality, Armorel, any reason, except that you
did not know anything about me.'</p>

<p>'Oh! but I saw you and talked with you.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but that was not enough. We do not ask people into
our houses unless we know something about them.'</p>

<p>'I could see that you were a gentleman.'</p>

<p>'You are very good to think so. Let me try to justify that
belief. But, Armorel, seriously, there are thieves and rogues and
wicked men in the world. Some of these may come to Scilly. Do
not ask another stranger. Believe me, it is dangerous. As for
me, you have shown me your flower-farm and have entertained me
hospitably: let me thank you and take my departure.'</p>

<p>'Go away? Take your departure? Why?' Armorel looked
ready to cry. 'You have only just come. You have seen nothing.'</p>

<p>'Do you wish me to stay another night?'</p>

<p>'Of course I do. What is it, Roland Lee? You have got
something on your mind. Why should you not stay?'</p>

<p>'I should like somebody,' he replied, weakly, 'to approve. If
the Ancestress, or even Dorcas, or Chessun herself, would approve&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why, of course Dorcas approves. She says it is the best
thing in the world for me to have someone here to talk to. She
said so yesterday evening, and again this morning.'</p>

<p>'In that case, Armorel, and since it is so delightful here&mdash;and
so new&mdash;and since you are so kind, I will stay one more
day.'</p>

<p>He remembered his friend's warning, and the grumpiness
which he showed on the way back. His conscience smote him,
but not severely. He would be very careful. And, after all, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
was but a child. He would just stay the one day and make a
sketch or two. Then he would go away.</p>

<p>'That is settled, then. One more day&mdash;or, perhaps, one more
week, or a month, or a year,' she said, laughing. 'And now,
before Peter is ready, I must leave you for ten minutes, because I
have to make a cake for your tea this evening. As for dinner, we
shall have that in the boat, or on one of the islands. It is my
business, you know, to make the puddings and the cakes.'</p>

<p>'Armorel&mdash;you shall not. I would rather go without.'</p>

<p>'You shall certainly not go without a cake. Why, I like to
make things. It would be dull here indeed if I had not got
things to do all day long.'</p>

<p>'Do you not find it dull sometimes, even with things to do?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. Sometimes. I suppose we are all of us tempted to
be discontented at times, even when we have so many blessings as
I enjoy.' Armorel was young enough, you see, to talk the language
of her nurses and serving-women.</p>

<p>'How do you get through the day?'</p>

<p>'I get up at six o'clock, except in winter, when it is too dark. I
have a run with Jack after breakfast; we run up the hill and down
the other side&mdash;round Porth Bay, just to see the waves beating on
White Island Ledge, where you very nearly&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Very nearly,' Roland echoed, 'but for you.'</p>

<p>'Then we run up Bryher Hill and stand on the carn just for
Jack to bark at the north wind.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes it rains.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes&mdash;and sometimes it blows such a gale of wind that I
could not stand on the carn for a moment. Then I stay at home
and make or mend something. There are always things to be
made or mended. Then we are always wanting stores of some
kind or other, and I have to go over to Hugh Town and buy them.
At Hugh Town there are shops where they keep beautiful things&mdash;you
can buy anything you want at Hugh Town. We cannot
make pins and needles at home, can we? Then we have dinner,
and Granny is brought in. Sometimes she wakes up then, and
gets lively, and knows everything that is going on. She will talk
quite sensibly for an hour at a time. And I have my fiddle to
practise. After tea, when the days are long enough, I go up on
the hills again and wander about till dark.'</p>

<p>'And do you never have any companions at all?' he asked with
a curious, unreasoning, perfectly inexcusable touch of jealousy,
because it could not matter to him even if all the young men of
St. Mary's and Bryher and Tresco and St. Martin's came over every
Sunday to court this dainty damsel. Yet he did feel the least bit
anxious.</p>

<p>'Never any companions. Nobody ever comes here. They
used to come, when Granny was still able to talk, in order to ask
her advice. She was so wise, you see.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>'And every evening you make music for the Ancestress and
the worthy Tryeth family?'</p>

<p>'Yes, and then I have supper and go to bed. Generally by
nine o'clock we are all asleep in the house.'</p>

<p>'It would be a monotonous life if you were older. But it is
only a preliminary or a preparation to something else. It is the
overture, played in soft music, to the happy comedy of your future
life, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'You mean to say something kind,' she replied. 'Of course,
my life must seem dull to you.'</p>

<p>'One cannot always live on lovely skies and sunlit seas and enchanted
islands.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes it seems to me that a little more talk would be
pleasant. Justinian talks very well, to be sure; but he is the only
one. He knows quantities of wrecks. It would astonish you to
hear him tell of the wrecks he has seen. Dorcas talks very little
now, because she has lost all her teeth. Chessun is a silent woman,
because she's always been kept under by her mother. And Peter's
not a talkative boy, because he's always been kept under both by
his father and his mother. Besides, he got that nasty fall which
made all his hair fall off. You can't wonder if he thinks about
that a good deal. And they are all getting old.'</p>

<p>'Yes. They seem to be getting very old indeed. Some day
they will follow the example of other old people and vanish.
Then, Armorel, you will be like Robinson Crusoe or Alexander
Selkirk.'</p>

<p>'I know all about Alexander Selkirk. He lived alone on Juan
Fernandez, having been put ashore by Captain Stradling, of the
"Cinque Ports." He had been four years and four months on the
island when Captain Woodes Rogers found him. He was clothed
in goat-skin. He built two huts with pimento-trees, and covered
them with long grass and lined them with the skin of goats. He
made fire by rubbing two sticks together on his knee. And he
lived by catching goats. You mean, Roland Lee,' she said, with
great seriousness, 'that some day or other all these old people
will die&mdash;my great-great-grandmother, Justinian, Dorcas, and even
Peter and Chessun, and that then I shall be alone on the island.
That would be terrible. But it will not happen in that way. I
am sure it will not, because it would be so very terrible. We are
in the Lord's hand, and it will not be allowed.'</p>

<p>The young man coloured and dropped his eyes. There certainly
was not a single girl of all those whom he knew in London who
could have said such a thing so simply and so sincerely. Not the
youngest girl fresh from the most religious teaching could say such
a thing. Yet they go to church a good deal oftener than Armorel,
whose chances were only once a week, and then only when the
weather was fine. This it is to be a Scillonian, and to believe
what you hear in church. Roland had no reply to make. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to hint that faith so simple and so complete was rare would have
been cruel and wicked.</p>

<p>'You have quoted Woodes Rogers,' he said presently. 'Have
you read that good old navigator? It is not often that one finds a
girl quoting from Woodes Rogers.'</p>

<p>'Oh! I do not read much. There is a bookcase full of books;
but I only read the voyages. There is a whole row of them.
Woodes Rogers, Shelvocke, Commodore Anson, Wallis, Carteret,
and Cook&mdash;and more besides. I like Carteret best, because his
ship was so small and so crazy, and his men so few and so weak,
and yet he would keep on traversing the ocean as long as he could,
and discovered a great deal more than his commander, who
cowardly deserted him.'</p>

<p>'There are other things in the world besides voyages&mdash;and other
books.'</p>

<p>'I learned the other things at school. There was geography&mdash;the
world is only the Scilly Islands spread out big&mdash;and history,
too. You would be surprised to find what a lot of English history
there is that belongs to Scilly. Queen Elizabeth built the Star
Fort&mdash;you've seen the Star Fort on the Garrison. There is Charles
the First's Castle, on Tresco, all in ruins; and, down below it,
Cromwell's Castle, which I will show you. And Charles the Second
stayed here. Oh! and there was the Spanish Armada; I must not
forget that, because of another great-great-far-off-great-grandfather,
three hundred years ago, who was wrecked here.'</p>

<p>'How was that?'</p>

<p>'He was a captain, or officer of some kind, on board one of the
Spanish ships; his name was Don Hernando Mureno. After the
Armada was defeated and driven away, some of the ships came
down the Irish Sea, and among them his ship&mdash;and she ran ashore
on one of the Outer Islands&mdash;I think on Maiden Bower. How
many were saved I cannot tell you; but some were, and among
them Don Hernando Mureno himself. He stayed here, and never
wanted to go away any more; but married a Scillonian, and lived
out his life on Bryher, and is buried at the old church at St. Mary's,
where I could show you his grave and the headstone&mdash;though the
letters are all gone by this time. I have his sword still, and I will
show it to you. One of my grandfathers married his granddaughter.
They say I take after the Spanish side.'</p>

<p>'You are a true Castilian, Armorel; unless, indeed, you happen
to be an Andalusian or a Biscayan.'</p>

<p>'Do you think I ought to read the other books?' she asked him,
anxiously. 'If you really think so, I will try&mdash;I will, really.'</p>

<p>I suppose that no young man&mdash;not even the most hardened
lecturers at Newnham&mdash;ever becomes quite indifferent to the spectacle
of Venus entrusting the care of her intellect to a young
philosopher. It is a moving spectacle, and still novel. It makes
a much more beautiful picture than that of Venus handing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the care of her soul to the Shaven and Shorn. Roland coloured.
He felt at once the responsibility and the delicacy of the task thus
offered him.</p>

<p>'We will look into the shelves,' he said. 'I suppose that the
Ancestress no longer reads?'</p>

<p>'She never learned to read at all. She can neither read nor
write: yet there was never anyone who knew so much. She could
cure all diseases, and the people came over here from all the islands
for her advice. Dorcas knew a great deal, but she does not know
the half or the quarter of her mistress's knowledge.'</p>

<p>'Armorel'&mdash;Roland knocked out the ashes of his pipe&mdash;'I
think you want&mdash;very badly&mdash;someone to advise you.'</p>

<p>'Will you advise me, Roland Lee?'</p>

<p>'Child'&mdash;he slowly got up&mdash;'all my life, so far, I have been
looking for someone to advise and help myself. You must not
lean upon a reed. Come&mdash;let us seek Peter the boy, and launch
the ship and go forth upon our voyage about this sea of many
islands. Perchance we may discover Circe upon one of them&mdash;unless
you are yourself Circe&mdash;and I shall presently find myself
transformed; but you are too good to turn me into anything except
a prince or a poet. And we may light upon St. Brandan's Land;
or we may find Judas Iscariot floating on that island of red-hot
brass; or we may chance on Andromeda, and witness the battle of
Perseus and the dragon; or we may find the weeping Ariadne&mdash;everything
is possible on an island.'</p>

<p>'Roland Lee,' said the girl, 'you are talking like your friend
Dick Stephenson. Why do you say such extravagant things?
This is the island of Samson, and I am nothing in the world but
Armorel Rosevean.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY</small></h2>


<p>All day long the boat sailed about among the channels and over
the shallow ledges of the Outer or Western Islands, whither no
boat may reach save on such a day, so quiet and so calm. The
visitor who comes by one boat and goes away by the next thinks
he has seen this archipelago. As well stand inside a great cathedral
for half an hour and then go away thinking you have seen it
all. It takes many days to see these fragments of Lyonesse, and
to get a time sense of the place. They sailed round the southern
point of Samson, and they steered westward, leaving Great
Minalto on the lee, towards Mincarlo, lying, like an old-fashioned
sofa, high at the two ends and flat in the middle. They found a
landing at the southern point, and clambered up the steep and
rocky sides of the low hill. On this island there are four peaks
with a down in the middle, all complete. It is like a doll's island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Everywhere in Scilly there are the same features: here a hill
strewn with boulders; here a little down, with fern and gorse and
heath; here a bay in which the water, on such days as it can be
approached, peacefully laps a smooth white beach; here dark
caves and holes in which the water always, even in the calmest
day of summer, grumbles and groans, and, when the least sea
rises, begins to roar and bellow&mdash;in time of storm it shrieks and
howls. Those who sail round these rumbling water-dungeons
begin to think of sea monsters. Hidden in those recesses the
awful calamary lies watching, waiting, his tentacles forty feet
long stretching out in the green water, floating innocently till they
touch their prey, then seizing and haling it within sight of the
baleful, gleaming eyes and within reach of the devouring mouth.
In these holes, too, lie the great conger-eels&mdash;they fear nothing
that swims except that calamary; and in these recesses walk about
the huge crabs which devour the dead bodies of shipwrecked
sailors. On the sunlit rocks one looks to see a mermaiden, with
glittering scales, combing out her long fair tresses: perhaps one
may unfortunately miss this beautiful sight, which is rare even in
Scilly; but one cannot miss seeing the seals flopping in the water
and swimming out to sea, with seeming intent to cross the broad
ocean. And in windy weather porpoises blow in the shallow
waters of the sounds. All round the rocks at low tide hangs the
long sea-weed, undisturbed since the days when they manufactured
kelp, like the rank growth of a tropical creeper: at high tide it
stands up erect, rocking to and fro in the wash and sway of the
water like the tree-tops of the forest in the breeze. Everywhere,
except in the rare places where men come and go, the wild sea-birds
make their nests; the shags stand on the ledges of the
highest rocks in silent rows gazing upon the water below; the sea-gulls
fly, shrieking in sea-gullic rapture&mdash;there is surely no life
quite so joyous as a sea-gull's; the curlews call; the herons sail
across the sky; and, in spring, millions of puffins swim and dive
and fly about the rocks, and lay their eggs in the hollow places of
these wild and lonely islands.</p>

<p>These things, which one presently expects and observes without
wonder in all the islands, were new to Roland when he set foot on
the rugged rock of Mincarlo. He climbed up the steep sides of
the rock and stood upon the top of its highest peak. He made two
or three rapid sketches of rock and sea, the girl looking over his
shoulder, watching curiously, for the first time in her life, the
growth of a picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="375" height="600" alt="Watching curiously, for the first time in her life,
the growth of a picture." title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Watching curiously, for the first time in her life,
the growth of a picture.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Then he stood and looked around. The great stones were piled
about; the brown turf crept up their sides; where there was
space to grow, the yellow branches of the fern were spread; and
on all four sides lay the shining water.</p>

<p>'All my life,' he said, 'I have dreamed of islands. This is true
joy, Armorel. For a permanency, Samson is better than Mincarlo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
because there is more of it. But to come here sometimes&mdash;to sit
on this carn while the wind whistles in your ear, and the waves are
lapping against the rocks all day long and always&mdash;&mdash;Armorel,
is there any other world? Are there men and women living
somewhere? Is there anybody but you and me&mdash;and Peter?' he
added, hastily. 'I don't believe in London. It is a dream. Everything
is a dream but the islands and the boat and Armorel.'</p>

<p>She was only a child, but she turned a rosy red at the compliment.
Nothing but the boat and herself. She was very fond of
the boat, you see, and she felt that the words conveyed a high
compliment. Then they began to explore the rest of this mountainous
island, which has such a variety of scenery all packed away
in the small space of twelve acres. When they had walked over
the whole of Mincarlo that is accessible, they returned to their
landing-place, where Peter sat in the boat keeping her off, with
head bent as if he was asleep.</p>

<p>'It must be half-past twelve,' said Armorel. 'I am sure you
are hungry. We will have dinner here.'</p>

<p>'No better place for a picnic. Come along, Peter. Bear a
hand with the basket. Here, Armorel, is a rock that will do for
a table, and here is one on which we two can sit. There is a rock
for you, Peter. Now! The opening of a luncheon-basket is
always a moment of grave anxiety. What have we got?'</p>

<p>'This is a rabbit-pie,' said Armorel. 'And this is a cake-pudding.
I made it yesterday. Do you like cake-pudding?
Here are bread and salt and things. Can you make your dinner
off a rabbit-pie, Roland Lee?'</p>

<p>'A very good dinner too.' The young man now understood
that on Samson one uses the word dinner instead of lunch, and
that supper is an excellent cold spread served at eight. 'A very
good dinner, Armorel. I mean to carve this. Sit down and let
me see you make a good dinner.'</p>

<p>An admirable rabbit-pie, and an excellent cake-pudding. Also,
there had not been forgotten a stone jar filled with that home-brewed
of which the like can no longer be found in any other spot
in the British Islands. I hope one need do no more than indicate
the truly appreciative havoc wrought by the young gentleman
among all these good gifts and blessings.</p>

<p>After dinner, to lie in the sunshine and have a pipe, looking
across the wide stretch of sunny water to the broken line of rocks
and the blue horizon beyond, was happiness undeserved. Beside
him sat the girl, anxious that he should be happy&mdash;thinking of
nothing but what might best please her guest.</p>

<p>Then they got into the boat again, and sailed half a mile or so
due north by the compass, until they came within another separate
archipelago, of which Mincarlo is an outlying companion.</p>

<p>It is the group of rocks, called the Outer or the Western Islands,
lying tumbled about in the water west of Bryher and Samson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Some of them are close together, some are separated by broad
channels. Here the sea is never calm: at the foot of the rocks
stretch out ledges, some of them bare at low water, revealing
their ugly black stone teeth: the swell of the Atlantic on the
calmest days rises and falls and makes white eddies, broken water,
and flying spray. Among these rocks they rowed: Peter and Roland
taking the oars, while Armorel steered. They rowed round Maiden
Bower, with its cluster of granite forts defying the whole strength
of the Atlantic, which will want another hundred thousand years
to grind them down&mdash;about and among the Black Rocks and the
Seal Rocks, dark and threatening: they landed on Ilyswillig, with
his peak of fifty feet, a strange wild island: they stood on the ledge
of Castle Bryher and looked up at the tower of granite which rises
out of the water like the round keep of a Norman castle: they
hoisted sail and stood out to Scilly himself, where his twin rocks
command the entrance to the islands. Scilly is of the dual number:
he consists of two great mountains rising from the water sheer,
precipitous, and threatening: each about eighty feet high, but with
the air of eight hundred; each black and square and terrible of
aspect: they are separated by a narrow channel hardly broad
enough for a boat to pass through.</p>

<p>'One day last year,' said Armorel&mdash;'it was in July, after a fortnight
of fine weather&mdash;we went through this channel, Peter and I&mdash;didn't
we, Peter? It was a dead calm, and at high tide.'</p>

<p>The boy nodded his head.</p>

<p>The channel was now, the tide being nearly high, like a foaming
torrent, through which the water raced and rushed, boiling into
whirlpools, foaming and tearing at the sides. The rapids below
Niagara are not fiercer than was this channel, though the day was
so fair and the sea without so quiet.</p>

<p>'Once,' said Peter, breaking the silence, 'there was a ship cast
up by a wave right into the fork of the channel. She went to
pieces in ten minutes, for she was held in a vice like, while the
waves beat her into sticks. Some of the men got on to the north
rock&mdash;what they call "Cuckoo"&mdash;and there they stuck till the
gale abated. Then people saw them from Bryher, and a pilot-boat
put off for them.'</p>

<p>'So they were saved?' said Roland.</p>

<p>'No, they were not saved,' Peter replied, slowly. ''Twas this
way: the pilot-boat that took them off the rock capsized on the
way home. So they was all drowned.'</p>

<p>'Poor beggars! Now, if they had been brought safe ashore we
might have been told what these rocks look like in rough weather:
and what Scilly is like when you have climbed it: and how a man
feels in the middle of a storm on Scilly.'</p>

<p>'You can see very well what it is like from Samson,' said
Armorel. 'The waves beat upon the rocks, and the white spray
flies over them and hides them.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>'I should like to hear as well as to see,' said Roland. 'Fancy
the thunder of the Atlantic waves against this mass of rock, the
hissing and boiling in the channel, the roaring of the wind and
the dashing of the waves! I wonder if any of these shipwrecked
men had a sketch-book in his pocket.</p>

<p>'To be drowned,' he continued, 'just by the upsetting of a boat,
and after escaping death in a much more exciting manner! Their
companions were torn from the deck and hurled and dashed against
the rock, so that in a moment their bones were broken to fragments,
and the fragments themselves were thrown against the rocks till
there was nothing left of them. And these poor fellows clung to
the rock, hiding under a boulder from the driving wind&mdash;cold,
starving, wet, and miserable. And just as they thought of food
and shelter and warmth again, to be taken and plunged into the
cold water, there to roll about till they were drowned! A dreadful
tragedy!'</p>

<p>Having thus broken the ice, Peter proceeded to relate more
stories of shipwreck, taking after his father, Justinian Tryeth,
whose conversational powers in this direction were, according to
Armorel, unrivalled. There is a shipwreck story belonging to
every rock of Scilly, and to many there are several shipwrecks.
As there are about as many rocks of Scilly as there are days in the
year, the stories would take long in the telling.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Peter did not know all. It is natural, however,
that a native of Samson, and the descendant of many generations
of wreckers, should love to talk about wrecks. Therefore he proceeded
to tell of the French frigate which came over to conquer
Scilly in 1798, and was very properly driven ashore by the sea
which owns allegiance to Britannia, and all hands lost, so that the
Frenchmen captured no more than their graves, which now lie in
a triumphant row on St. Agnes. On Maiden Bower he placed, I
know not with what truth, the wreck of the Spaniard which gave
Armorel an ancestor. On Mincarlo he remembered the loss of an
orange-ship on her way from the Azores. On Menovaur he had
seen a collier driven in broad daylight and broken all to pieces in
half a day, and of her crew not a man saved. Other things,
similarly cheerful, he narrated slowly while the sunshine made
these grey rocks put on a hospitable look and the boat danced over
the rippling waves. With his droning voice, his smooth face with
the long white hair upon it, like the last scanty leaves upon a tree,
he was like the figure of Death at the Feast, while Armorel&mdash;young,
beautiful, smiling&mdash;reminded her guest of Life, and Love,
and Hope.</p>

<p>They sailed round so many of these rocks and islets: they
landed on so many: they lingered so long among the reefs, loth
to leave the wild, strange place, that the sun was fast going down
when they hoisted sail and steered for New Grinsey Sound on their
homeward way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>You may enter New Grinsey Sound either from the north or
from the south. The disadvantage of attempting it from the
former on ordinary days is that those who do so are generally
capsized and frequently drowned. On such a day as this, however,
the northern passage may be attempted. It is the channel,
dangerous and beset with rocks and ledges, between the islands of
Bryher and Tresco. As the boat sailed slowly in, losing the
breeze as it rounded the point, the channel spread itself out broad
and clear. On the right hand rose, precipitous, the cliffs and crags
of Shipman's Head, which looks like a continuation of Bryher,
but is really separated from the island by a narrow passage&mdash;you
may work through it in calm weather&mdash;running from Hell Bay to
the Sound. On the left is Tresco, its downs rising steeply from
the water, and making a great pretence of being a very lofty ascent
indeed. In the middle of the coast juts out a high promontory,
surrounded on all sides but one by the water. On this rock stands
Cromwell's Castle, a round tower, older than the Martello Towers.
It still possesses a roof, but its interior has been long since gutted.
In front of it has been built a square stone platform or bastion,
where once, no doubt, they mounted guns for the purpose of
defending this channel against an invader, as if Nature had not
already defended it by her ledges and shallows and hardly concealed
teeth of granite. To protect by a fort a channel when the
way is so tortuous and difficult, and where there are so many other
ways, is almost as if Warkworth Castle, five miles inland, on the
winding Coquet, had been built to protect the shores of Northumberland
from the invading Dane: or as if Chepstow above the
muddy Wye had been built for the defence of Bristol. There,
however, the castle is, and a very noble picture it made as the
boat slowly voyaged through the Sound. The declining sun, not
yet sunk too low behind Bryher, clothed it with light and splendour,
and brought out the rich colour of grey rock and yellow fern upon
the steep hillside behind. Beyond the castle, in the midst of the
Sound, rose a pyramidal island, a pile of rocks, seventy or eighty
feet high, on whose highest carn some of Oliver Cromwell's
prisoners were hanged, according to the voice of tradition, which,
somehow, always goes dead against that strong person.</p>

<p>Roland, who had exhausted the language of delight among
the Outer Islands, contemplated this picture in silence.</p>

<p>'Do you not like it?' asked the girl.</p>

<p>'Like it?' he repeated. 'Armorel! It is splendid.'</p>

<p>'Will you make a sketch of it?'</p>

<p>'I cannot. I must make a picture. I ought to come here day
after day. There must be a good place to take it from&mdash;over
there, I think, on that beach. Armorel! It is splendid. To
think that the picture is to be seen so near to London, and that
no one comes to see it!'</p>

<p>'If you want to come day after day, Roland,' she said, softly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
'you will not be able to go away to-morrow. You must stay
longer with us on Samson.'</p>

<p>'I ought not, child. You should not ask me.'</p>

<p>'Why should you not stay if you are happy with us? We will
make you as comfortable as ever we can. You have only to tell
us what you want.'</p>

<p>She looked so eagerly and sincerely anxious that he yielded.</p>

<p>'If you are really and truly sure,' he said.</p>

<p>'Of course I am really and truly sure. The weather will be
fine, I think, and we will go sailing every day.'</p>

<p>'Then I will stay a day or two longer. I will make a picture
of Cromwell's Castle&mdash;and the hill at the back of it and the water
below it. I will make it for you, Armorel; but I will keep a copy
of it for myself. Then we shall each have a memento of this day&mdash;something
to remember it by.'</p>

<p>'I should like to have the picture. But, oh! Roland!&mdash;as if
I could ever forget this day!'</p>

<p>She spoke with perfect simplicity, this child of Nature, without
the least touch of coquetry. Why should she not speak what was
in her heart? Never before had she seen a young man so brave,
so gallant, so comely: nor one who spoke so gently: nor one who
treated her with so much consideration.</p>

<p>He turned his face: he could not meet those trustful eyes,
with the innocence that lay there: he was abashed by reason of
this innocence. A child&mdash;only a child. Armorel would change.
In a year or two this trustfulness would vanish. She would
become like all other girls&mdash;shy and reserved, self-conscious in
intuitive self-defence. But there was no harm as yet. She was
a child&mdash;only a child.</p>

<p>As the sun went down the bows ran into the fine white sand of
the landing-place, and their voyage was ended.</p>

<p>'A perfect day,' he murmured. 'A day to dream of. How
shall I thank you enough, Armorel?'</p>

<p>'You can stay and have some more days like it.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE VOYAGERS</small></h2>


<p>This was the first of many such voyages and travels, though not
often in the outside waters, for the vexed Bermoothes themselves
are not more lashed by breezes from all the quarters of the compass
than these isles of Scilly. They sailed from point to point,
and from island to island, landing where they listed or where
Armorel led, wandering for long hours round the shores or on
the hills. All the islands, except the bare rocks, are covered
with down and moorland, bounded in every direction by rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
headlands and slopes covered with granite boulders. They were
quite alone in their explorations: no native is ever met upon
those downs: no visitor, except on St. Mary's, wanders on the
beaches and around the bays. They were quite alone all the day
long: the sea-breeze whistled in their ears; the gulls flew over
their heads&mdash;the cormorants hardly stirred from the rocks when
they climbed up; the hawk that hung motionless in the air above
them changed not his place when they drew near. And always,
day after day, they came continually upon unexpected places:
strange places, beautiful places: beaches of dazzling white: wildly
heaped carns: here a cromlech, a logan stone, a barrow&mdash;Samson
is not the only island which guards the tombs of the Great
Departed&mdash;a new view of sea and sky and white-footed rock. I
believe that there does not live any single man who has actually
explored all the isles of Scilly: stood upon every rock, climbed
every hill, and searched on every island for its treasures of ancient
barrows, plants, birds, carns, and headlands. Once there was a
worthy person who came here as chaplain to St. Martin's. He
started with the excellent intention of seeing everything. Alas!
he never saw a single island properly: he never walked round
one exhaustively. He wrote a book about them, to be sure; but
he saw only half. As for Samson, this person of feeble intelligence
even declared that the island was not worth a second visit!
After that one would shut the book, but is lured on in the hope
of finding something new.</p>

<p>One must not ask of the islanders themselves for information
about the isles, because few of them ever go outside their own
island unless to Hugh Town, where is the Port, and where are the
shops. Why should they? On the other islands they have no
business. Justinian Tryeth, for instance, was seventy-five years of
age; Hugh Town he knew, and had often been there, though now
Peter did the business of the farm at the Port: St. Agnes he
knew, having wooed and won a wife there: he had been to Bryher
Church, which is close to the shore&mdash;the rest of Bryher was to
him as unknown as Iceland. As for St. Martin's, or Annet, or
Great Ganilly, he saw them constantly; they were always within
his sight, yet he had never desired to visit them. They were an
emblem, a shape, a name to him, and nothing more. It is so
always with those who live in strange and beautiful places: the
marvels are part of their daily life: they heed them not, unless,
like Armorel, they have no work to do and are quick to feel the
influences of things around them. Most Swiss people seem to
care nothing for their Alps, but here and there is one who would
gladly spend all his days high up among the fragrant pines, or
climbing the slope of ice with steady step and slow.</p>

<p>But these young people did try to visit all the islands. Upon
Roland there fell the insatiate curiosity&mdash;the rage&mdash;of an explorer
and a discoverer. He became like Captain Cook himself: he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
longed for more islands: every day he found a new island. 'Give,'
cries he who sails upon unknown seas and scans the round circle
of the horizon for the cloudy peak of some far-distant mountain,
'give&mdash;give more islands&mdash;still more islands! Let us sail for
yonder cloud! Let us sail on until the cloud becomes a hill-top,
and the hill another island! Largesse for him who first calls
"Land ahead!" There shall we find strange monsters and
treasures rare, with friendly natives, and girls more blooming than
those of fair Tahiti. Let us sail thither, though it prove no more
than a barren rock, the resting-place of the sea-lion; though we
can do no more than climb its steep sides and stand upon the top
while the spray flies over the rocks and beats upon our faces.' In
such a spirit as Captain Carteret (Armorel's favourite) steered
his frail bark from shore to shore did Roland sail among those
Scilly seas.</p>

<p>Of course they went to Tresco, where there is the finest garden
in all the world. But one should not go to see the garden more
than once, because its perfumed alleys, its glasshouses, its cultivated
and artificial air, are somehow incongruous with the rest of
the islands. As well expect to meet a gentleman in a Court dress
walking across Fylingdale Moor. Yet it is indeed a very noble
and royal garden: other gardens have finer hothouses: none have
a better show of flowers and trees of every kind: for variety it is
like unto the botanical gardens of a tropical land: you might be
standing in one of the alleys of the garden of Mauritius, or of
Java, or the Cape. Here everything grows and flourishes that will
grow anywhere, except, of course, those plants which carry
patriotism to an extreme and refuse absolutely to leave their native
soil. You cannot go picking pepper here, nor can you strip the
cinnamon-tree of its bark. But here you will see the bamboos
cluster, tall and graceful: the eucalyptus here parades his naked
trunk and his blue leaves: here the fern-tree lifts its circle of glory
of lace and embroidery twenty feet high: the prickly pear nestles
in warm corners: the aloe shoots up its tall stalk of flower and of
seed: the palms stand in long rows: and every lovely plant, every
sweet flower, created for the solace of man, grows abundantly, and
hastens with zeal to display its blossoms: the soft air is full of
perfumes, strange and familiar: it is as if Kew had taken off her
glass roofs and placed all her plants and trees to face the English
winter. But, then, the winter of Scilly is not the winter of Great
Britain. The botanist may visit this garden many times, and always
find something to please him; but the ordinary traveller will
go but once, and admire and come away. It is far better outside
on the breezy down, where the dry fern and withered bents crack
beneath your feet, and the elastic turf springs as you tread upon it.
There are other things on Tresco: there is a big fresh-water lake&mdash;it
would be a respectable lake even in Westmoreland&mdash;where
the wild birds disport themselves: beside it South American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
ostriches roam gravely, after the manner of the bird. It is pleasant
to see the creatures. There is a great cave, if you like dark
damp caves: better than the cave, there is a splendid bold coast
sloping steeply from the down all round the northern part of the
island.</p>

<p>Then they walked all round St. Mary's. It is nine miles
round; but if, as these young people did, you climb every headland
and walk round every bay, and descend every possible place where
the boulders make a ladder down to the boiling water below, it is
nine hundred miles round, and, for its length, the most wonderful
walk in all the world. They crossed the broad Sound to St.
Agnes, and saw St. Warna's wondrous cove: they stood on the
desolate Gugh and the lonely Annet, beloved of puffins: they
climbed on every one of the Eastern Islands, and even sailed, when
they found a day calm enough to permit the voyage, among the
Dogs of Scilly, and clambered up the black boulders of Rosevear
and scared the astonished cormorants from wild Goreggan.</p>

<p>One day it rained in the morning. Then they had to stay at
home, and Armorel showed the house. She took her guest into
the dairy, where Chessun made the butter and scalded the cream&mdash;that
rich cream which the West-country folk eat with everything.
She made him stand by and help make a junket, which Devonshire
people believe cannot be made outside the shadow of Dartmoor:
she took him into the kitchen&mdash;the old room with its old furniture,
the candlesticks and snuffers of brass, the bacon hanging to the
joists, the blue china, the ancient pewter platters, the long bright
spit&mdash;a kitchen of the eighteenth century. And then she took him
into a room which no longer exists anywhere else save in name. It
was the still-room, and on the shelves there stood the elixirs
and cordials of ancient time: the currant gin to fortify the stomach
on a raw morning before crossing the Road; the cherry brandy for
a cold and stormy night; the elderberry wine, good mulled and
spiced at Christmas-time; the blackberry wine; the home-made
distilled waters&mdash;lavender water, Hungary water, Cyprus water,
and the Divine Cordial itself, which takes three seasons to complete,
and requires all the flowers of spring, summer, and autumn.
Then they went into the best parlour, and Armorel, opening a
cupboard, took out an old sword of strange shape and with faded
scabbard. On the blade there was a graven Latin legend. 'This
is my ancestor's sword,' she said. 'He was an officer of the
Spanish Armada&mdash;Hernando Mureno was his name.'</p>

<p>'You are indeed a Spanish lady, Armorel. Your ancestor is
well known to have been the bravest and most honourable gentleman
in King Philip's service.'</p>

<p>'He remained here&mdash;he would not go home: he married and
became a Protestant.'</p>

<p>She put back the sword in its place, and brought forth other
things to show him&mdash;old-fashioned watches, old compasses, sextants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
telescopes, flint-and-steel pistols&mdash;all kinds of things belonging to
the old days of smuggling and of piloting.</p>

<p>Then she opened the bookcase. It should have been filled with
histories of pirates and buccaneers; but it was not: it contained a
whole body of theology of the Methodist kind. Roland tossed
them over impatiently. 'I don't wonder,' he said, 'at your reading
nothing if this is all you have.' But he found one or two
books which he set aside.</p>

<p>As they wandered about the islands, of course they talked. It
wants but little to make a young man open his heart to a girl;
only a pair of soft and sympathetic eyes, a face full of interest and
questions of admiration. Whether she tells him anything in
return is quite another matter. Most young men, when they
review the situation afterwards, discover that they have told everything
and learned nothing. Perhaps there is nothing to learn. In
a few days Armorel knew everything about her guest. He had
come from Australia&mdash;from that far-distant land&mdash;in search of
fortune. He had as yet made but few friends. He was unknown
and without patrons. He had no family connections which would
help him. The patrimony on which he was to live until he should
begin to succeed was but small, and although he held money-making
in the customary contempt, it was necessary that he should
make a good deal, because&mdash;which is often the case&mdash;his standard of
comfort was pitched rather high: it included, for instance, a good
club, good cigars, and good claret. Also, as he said, an artist should
be free from sordid anxieties: Art demands an atmosphere of calm:
therefore, he must have an income. This, like everything that
does not exist, must be created. Man is godlike because he alone
of creatures can create: he, and he alone, constantly creates things
which previously did not exist&mdash;an income, honour, rank, tastes,
wants, desires, necessities, habits, rules, and laws.</p>

<p>'How can you bear to sell your pictures?' asked the girl. 'We
sell our flowers, but then we grow them by the thousand. You
make every picture by itself&mdash;how can you sell the beautiful things?
You must want to keep them every one to look at all your life.
Those that you have given to me I could never part with.'</p>

<p>'One must live, fair friend of mine,' he replied, lightly. 'It is
my only way of making money, and without money we can do
nothing. It is not the selling of his pictures that the artist dreads&mdash;that
is the necessity of Art as a profession: it is the danger that
no one will care about seeing them or buying them. That is much
more terrible, because it means failure. Sometimes I dream that
I have become old and grey, and have been working all my life,
and have had no success at all, and am still unknown and despised.
In Art there are thousands of such failures. I think the artist
who fails is despised more than any other man. It is truly miserable
to aspire so high and to fall so low. Yet who am I that I
should reach the port?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>'All good painters succeed,' said the girl, who had never seen
a painter before or any painting save her own coloured engravings.
'You are a good painter, Roland. You must succeed. You will
become a great painter in everybody's estimation.'</p>

<p>'I will take your words for an oracle,' he said. 'When I am
melancholy, and the future looks dark, I will say, "Thus and thus
spoke Armorel."'</p>

<p>The young man who is about to attempt fortune by the pursuit
of Art must not consider too long the wrecks that strew the shores
and float about the waters, lest he lose self-confidence. Continually
these wrecks occur, and there is no insurance against them: yet
continually other barques hoist sail and set forth upon their perilous
voyage. It may be reckoned as a good point in this aspirant that
he was not over-confident.</p>

<p>'Some are wrecked at the outset,' he said. 'Others gain a kind
of success. Heavens! what a kind! To struggle all their lives
for admission to the galleries, and to rejoice if once in a while a
picture is sold.'</p>

<p>'They are not the good painters,' the girl of large experience
again reminded him.</p>

<p>'Am I a good painter?' he replied, humbly. 'Well, one can
but try to do good work, and leave to the gods the rest. There is
luck in things. It is not every good man who succeeds, Armorel.
To every man, however, there is allotted the highest stature
possible for him to reach. Let me be contented if I grow to my
full height.'</p>

<p>'You must, Roland. You could not be contented with anything
less.'</p>

<p>'To reach one's full height, one must live for work alone. It
is a hard saying, Armorel. It is a great deal harder than you can
understand.'</p>

<p>'If you love your work, and if you are happy in it&mdash;&mdash;' said
the girl.</p>

<p>'You do not understand, child, Most men never reach their
full height. You can see their pictures in the galleries&mdash;poor,
stunted things. It is because they live for anything rather than
their work. They are pictures without a soul in them.'</p>

<p>Now, when a young man holds forth in this strain, one or two
things suggest themselves. First, one thinks that he is playing a
part, putting on 'side,' affecting depths&mdash;in fact, enacting the part
of the common Prig, who is now, methinks, less common than he
was. If he is not a prig uttering insincere sentimentalities, he
may be a young man who has preserved his ideals beyond the usual
age by some accident. The ideals and beliefs and aspirations of
young men, when they first begin the study of Art in any of its
branches, are very beautiful things, and full of truths which can
only, somehow, be expressed by very young men. The third
explanation is that in certain circumstances, as in the companionship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of a girl not belonging to society and the world&mdash;a young,
innocent, and receptive girl&mdash;whose mind is ready for pure ideas,
uncontaminated by earthly touch, the old enthusiasms are apt to
return and the old beliefs to come back. Then such things may
spring in the heart and rise to the lips as one could not think or
utter in a London studio.</p>

<p>Sincere or not, this young man pursued his theme, making a
kind of confession which Armorel could not, as yet, understand.
But she remembered. Women at all ages remember tenaciously,
and treasure up in their hearts things which they may at some
other time learn to understand.</p>

<p>'There was an old allegory, Armorel,' this young man went on,
'of a young man choosing his way, once for all. It is an absurd
story, because every day and all day long we are pulled the other
way. Sometimes it makes me tremble all over only to think of
the flowery way. I know what the end would be. But yet,
Armorel, what can you know or understand about the Way of
Pleasure, and how men are drawn into it with ropes? My soul is
sometimes sick with yearning when I think of those who run along
that Way and sing and feast.'</p>

<p>'What kind of Way is it, Roland?'</p>

<p>'You cannot understand, and I cannot tell you. The Way of
Pleasure and the Way of Wealth. These are the two roads by
which the artistic life is ruined. Yet we are dragged into them by
ropes.'</p>

<p>'You shall keep to the true path, Roland,' the girl said, with
glistening eyes. 'Oh! how happy you will be when you have
reached your full height&mdash;you will be a giant then.'</p>

<p>He laughed and shook his head. 'Again, Armorel, I will take
it from your lips&mdash;a prophecy. But you do not understand.'</p>

<p>'No,' she said. 'I am very ignorant. Yet if I cannot understand,
I can remember. The Way of Pleasure and the Way of
Wealth. I shall remember. We are told that we must not set
our hearts upon the things of this world. I used to think that it
meant being too fond of pretty frocks and ribbons. Dorcas said
so once. Since you have come I see that there are many, many
things that I know nothing of. If I am to be dragged to them by
ropes, I do not want to know them. The Way of Pleasure and
the Way of Wealth. They destroy the artistic life,' she repeated,
as if learning a lesson. 'These ways must be ways of Sin, don't
you think?' she asked, looking up with curious eyes.</p>

<p>Doubtless. Yet this is not quite the modern manner of regarding
and speaking of the subject. And considering what an
eighteenth-century and bourgeois-like manner it is, and how fond
we now are of that remarkable century, one is surprised that the
manner has not before now been revived. When we again tie our
hair behind and assume silver-buckled shoes and white silk stockings,
we shall once more adopt that manner. It was not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
artificial with Armorel. The words fell naturally from her lips.
A thing that was prejudicial to the better nature of a man must,
she thought, belong to ways of Sin. Again&mdash;doubtless. But Roland
did not think of it in that way, and the words startled him.</p>

<p>'Puritan!' he said. 'But you are always right. It is the
instinct of your heart always to be right. But we no longer talk
that language. It is a hundred years old. In these days there is
no more talk about Sin&mdash;at least, outside certain circles. There
are habits, it is true, which harm an artist's eye and destroy his
hand. We say that it is a pity when an artist falls into these
habits. We call it a pity, Armorel, not the way of Sin. A pity&mdash;that
is all. It means the same thing, I dare say, so far as the
artist is concerned.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE LAST DAY BUT ONE</small></h2>


<p>The last day but one! It always comes at length&mdash;it is bound to
come&mdash;the saddest, the most sentimental of all days. The boy who
leaves school&mdash;I speak of the old-fashioned boy and the ancient
school&mdash;where he has been fagged and bullied and flogged,
on this last day but one looks round with a choking throat upon
the dingy walls and the battered desks. Even the convict who is
about to be released after years of prison feels a sentimental
melancholy in gazing for the last time upon the whitewashed
walls. The world, which misunderstands the power of temptation
and is distrustful as to the reality of repentance, will probably
prove cold to him. How much more, then, when one looks around
on the last day but one of a holiday! To-morrow we part. This
is the last day of companionship.</p>

<p>Roland's holiday was to consist of a day or two, or three at the
most&mdash;yet lo! the evening and the morning were the twenty-first
day. There was always something new to be seen, something
more to be sketched, some fresh excuse for staying in a house where
this young man lived from the first as if he had been there all his
life and belonged to the family. Scilly has to be seen in cloud as
well as in sunshine: in wind and rain as well as in fair weather: one
island had been accidentally overlooked; another must be re-visited.</p>

<p>So the days went on, each one like the days before it, but with
a difference. The weather was for the most part fine, so that they
could at least sail about the islands of the Road. Every morning
the young man got up at six and, after a bathe from Shark Point,
walked all round Samson and refreshed his soul by gazing upon
the Outer Islands. Breakfast over, he took a pipe in the farmyard
with Justinian and Peter, who continually talked of shipwrecks
and of things washed ashore. During this interval Armorel
made the puddings and the cakes. When she had accomplished
this delicate and responsible duty, she came out, prepared for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
day. They took their dinner-basket with them, and sallied forth:
in the afternoon they returned: in the evening, at seven o'clock,
the table was pushed back: the old serving people came in;
the fire was stirred into animation; Armorel played the old-fashioned
tunes; and the ancient lady rallied, and sat up, and
talked, her mind in the past. All the days alike, yet each one
differing from its neighbours. There is no monotony, though place
and people remain exactly the same, when there is the semblance of
variety. For, besides the discovery of so many curious and interesting
islands, this fortunate young man, as we have seen, discovered that
his daily companion, though so young&mdash;'only a child'&mdash;was a girl of
wonderful quickness and ready sympathy. A young artist wants sympathy&mdash;it
is necessary for his growth: sympathy, interest, and flattery
are necessary for the artistic temperament. All these Armorel
offered him in large measure, running over. She kept alive in
him that faith in his own star which every artist, as well as every
general, must possess. Great is the encouragement of such sympathy
to the young man of ambitions. This consideration is,
indeed, the principal excuse for early marriages. Three weeks of
talk with such a girl&mdash;no one else to consider or to interrupt&mdash;no
permission to be sought&mdash;surely these things made up a holiday
which quite beat the record! Three whole weeks! Such a holiday
should form the foundation of a life-long friendship! Could
either of them ever forget such a holiday?</p>

<p>Now it was all over. For very shame Roland could make no
longer any excuses for staying. His sketch-book was crammed.
There were materials in it for a hundred pictures&mdash;most of them
might be called Studies of Armorel. She was in the boat holding
the tiller, bare-headed, her hair flying in the breeze, the spray
dashing into her face, and the clear blue water rushing past the
boat: or she was sitting idly in the same boat lying in Grinsey
Sound, with Shipman's Head behind her: or she was standing on
the sea-weed at low water under the mighty rock of Castle Bryher:
or she was standing upright in the low room, violin in hand, her
face and figure crimsoned in the red firelight: or she was standing
in the porch between the verbena-trees, the golden figure-head
smiling benevolently upon her, and the old ships lanthorn swinging
overhead with an innocent air, as if it had never heard of a
wreck and knew not how valuable a property may be a cow, judiciously
treated&mdash;with a lighted lanthorn between its horns&mdash;on a
stormy night. There were other things: sketches of bays and coves,
and headlands and carns, gathered from all the islands&mdash;from Porthellick
and Peninnis on St. Mary's, which everybody goes to see, to
St. Warna's Cove on St. Agnes, whither no traveller ever wendeth.</p>

<p>A very noble time. No letters, no newspapers, no trouble of
any kind: yet one cannot remain for ever even in a house where
such a permanent guest would be welcomed. Now and then, it is
true, one hears how such a one went to a friend's house and stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
there. La Fontaine, Gay, and Coleridge are examples. But I
have never heard, before this case, of a young man going to a house
where a quite young girl, almost a child, was the mistress, and
staying there. Now the end had come: he must go back to
London, where all the men and most of the women have their own
shows to run, and there is not enough sympathy to go round: back
to what the young artist, he who has as yet exhibited little and
sold nothing, calls his Work&mdash;putting a capital letter to it, like the
young clergyman. Perhaps he did not understand that under the
eyes of a girl who knew nothing about Art he had done really
better and finer work, and had learned more, in those three weeks
than in all the time that he had spent in a studio. Well; it was
all over. The sketching was ended: there would be no more
sailing over the blue waves of the rolling Atlantic outside the
islands: no more quiet cruising in the Road: no more fishing: no
more clambering among the granite rocks: no more sitting in sunny
places looking out to sea, with this bright child at his side.</p>

<p>Alas! And no more talks with Armorel. From the first day
the child sat at his feet and became his disciple, Heloïse herself
was not an apter pupil. She ardently desired to learn: like a
curious child she asked him questions all day long, and received
the answers as if they were gospel: but no child that he had ever
known betrayed blacker gaps of ignorance than this girl of fifteen.
Consider. What could she know? Other girls learn at school:
Armorel's schooling was over at fourteen, when she came home
from St. Mary's to her desert island. Other girls continue their
education by reading books: but Armorel never read anything
except voyages of the last century, which treat but little of the
modern life. Other girls also learn from hearing their elders talk:
but Armorel's elders never talked. Other girls, again, learn from
conversation with companions: but Armorel had no companions.
And they learn from the shops in the street, the people who walk
about, from the church, the theatre, the shows: but Armorel had
no better street than the main street of Hugh Town. And they
learn from society: but this girl had none. And they learn from
newspapers, magazines, and novels: but Armorel had none of
these. No voice, no sound of the outer world reached Alexandra
Selkirk of Samson. Juan Fernandez itself was not more cut off
from men and women. Therefore, in her seclusion and her ignorance,
this young man came to her like another Apollo or a Vishnu
at least&mdash;a revelation of the world of which she knew nothing,
and to which she never gave a thought. He opened a door and
bade her look within. All she saw was a great company painting
pictures and talking Art; but that was something. As for what
he said, this young man ardent, she remembered and treasured all,
even the lightest things, the most trivial opinions. He did not
abuse her confidence. Had he been older he might have been
cynical: had he not been an artist he might have been flippant:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
had he been a City man and a money-grub he might have shown
her the sordid side of the world. Being such as he was he showed
her the best and most beautiful part&mdash;the world of Art. But as for
these black gaps of ignorance, most of them remained even after
Roland's visit.</p>

<p>'Your best friend, Armorel,' said her guest, 'would not deny
that you are ignorant of many things. You have never gone to a
dinner-party or sat in a drawing-room: you cannot play lawn-tennis;
you know none of the arts feminine: you cannot talk the
language of Society: oh! you are a very ignorant person indeed!
But then there are compensations.'</p>

<p>'What are compensations? Things that make up? Do you
mean the boat and the islands?'</p>

<p>'The boat is certainly something, and the islands give a flavour
of their own to life on Samson, don't they? If I were talking the
usual cant I should say that the chief compensation is the absence
of the hollow world and its insincere society. That is cant and
humbug, because society is very pleasant, only, I suppose, one
must not expect too much from it. Your real compensations,
Armorel, are of another kind. You can fiddle like a jolly sailor,
all of the olden time. If you were to carry that fiddle of yours on
to the Common Hard at Portsea not a man among them all, even
the decayed veteran&mdash;if he still lives&mdash;who caught Nelson, the
Dying Hero, in his arms, but would jump to his feet and shuffle&mdash;heel
and toe, double-step, back-step, flourish and fling. I believe
those terms are correct.'</p>

<p>'I am so glad you think I can fiddle.'</p>

<p>'You want only instruction in style to make you a very fine
violinist. Besides, there is nothing more pleasing to look at, just
now, than a girl playing a violin. It is partly fashion. Formerly
it was thought graceful for a girl to play the guitar, then the harp;
now it is the fiddle, when it is not the zither or the banjo. That is
one compensation. There is another. I declare that I do not
believe there is in all London a girl with such a genius as yours for
puddings and pies, cakes and biscuits. I now understand that there
is more wanted, in this confection, than industry and application.
It is an art. Every art affords scope for genius born not made.
The true&mdash;the really artistic&mdash;administration of spice and sugar,
milk, eggs, butter, and flour requires real genius&mdash;such as yours,
my child. And as to the still-room, there isn't such a thing left, I
believe, in the whole world except on Samson, any more than there
is a spinning-wheel. Who but yourself, Armorel, possesses the
secret, long since supposed to be hopelessly lost, of composing
Cyprus water, and the Divine Cordial? In this respect, you belong
to a hundred years ago, when the modern ignorance was unknown.
And where can I find&mdash;I should like to know&mdash;a London girl
who understands cherry brandy, and can make her own blackberry
wine?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>'You want to please me, Roland, because you are going away
and I am unhappy.' She hung her head in sadness too deep for
tears. 'That is why you say all these fine things. But I know
that they mean very little. I am only an ignorant girl.'</p>

<p>'I must always, out of common gratitude, want to please you.
But I am only speaking the bare truth. Then there is the delicate
question of dress. An ordinary man is not supposed to know anything
about dress, but an artist has always to consider it. There
are certainly other girls&mdash;thousands of other girls&mdash;more expensively
dressed than you, Armorel; but you have the taste for
costume, which is far better than any amount of costly stuff.'</p>

<p>'Chessun taught me how to sew and how to cut out.' But the
assurance of this excellence brought her no comfort.</p>

<p>'When I am gone, Armorel, you will go on with your drawing,
will you not?' It will be seen that he endeavoured, as an Apostle
of Art, to introduce its cult even on remote Samson. That was so,
and not without success. The girl, he discovered, had been always
making untaught attempts at drawing, and wanted nothing but a
little instruction. This was a fresh discovery. 'That you should
have the gift of the pencil is delightful to think of. The pencil,
you see, is like the Jinn&mdash;I fear you have no Jinn on Samson&mdash;who
could do almost anything for those who knew how to command his
obedience, but only made those people ridiculous who ignorantly
tried to order him around. If you go on drawing every day I
am sure you will learn how to make that Jinn obedient. I will
send you, when I get home, some simple books for your guidance.
Promise, child, that you will not throw away this gift.'</p>

<p>'I will draw every day,' she replied, obediently, but with profound
dejection.</p>

<p>'Then there is your reading. You must read something. I
have looked through your shelves, and have picked out some books
for you. There is a volume of Cowper and of Pope, and an old
copy of the <i>Spectator</i>, and there is Goldsmith's "Deserted Village."'</p>

<p>'I will read anything you wish me to read,' she replied.</p>

<p>'I will send you some more books. You ought to know something
about the world of to-day. Addison and Goldsmith will not
teach you that. But I don't know what to send you. Novels are
supposed to represent life; but then they pre-suppose a knowledge
of the world, to begin with. You want an account of modern
society as it is, and the thing does not exist. I will consider
about it.'</p>

<p>'I will read whatever you send me. Roland, when I have read
all the books and learned to draw, shall I have grown to my full
height? Remember what you said about yourself.'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Armorel. It is not reading. But&mdash;&mdash;' He
left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>'Who is to tell me&mdash;on Samson?' she asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon of this day Roland planted his easel on the
plateau of the northern hill, where the barrows are, and put the
last touches to the sketch, which he afterwards made into the first
picture which he ever exhibited. It appeared in the Grosvenor of
'85: of course everybody remembers the picture, which attracted a
very respectable amount of attention. It was called the 'Daughter
of Lyonesse.' It represented a maiden in the first blossom of
womanhood&mdash;tall and shapely. She was dressed in a robe of white
wool thrown over her left shoulder and gathered at the waist by a
simple belt of brown leather: a white linen vest was seen below
the wool: round her neck was a golden torque: behind her was
the setting sun: she stood upon the highest of a low pile of granite
boulders, round the feet of which were spread the yellow branches
of the fern and the faded flowers of the heather: she shaded her
eyes from the sun with her left hand, and looked out to sea. She
was bare-headed: the strong breeze lifted her long black hair and
blew it from her shoulders: her eyes were black and her complexion
was dark. Behind her and below her was the splendour
of sun and sky and sea, with the Western Islands rising black above
the golden waters.</p>

<p>The sketch showed the figure, but the drapery was not complete:
as yet it was a study of light and colour and a portrait.</p>

<p>'I don't quite know,' said the painter, thoughtfully, 'whether
you ought not to wear a purple chiton: Ph&oelig;nician trade must
have brought Ph&oelig;nician luxuries to Lyonesse. Your ancestors
were tin-men&mdash;rich miners&mdash;no doubt the ladies of the family went
dressed in the very, very best. I wonder whether in those days
the King's daughter was barefooted. The <i>caliga</i>, I think&mdash;the
leather sandal&mdash;would have been early introduced into the royal
family on account of the spikiness of the fern in autumn and the
thorns of the gorse all the year round. The slaves and common
people, of course, would have to endure the thorns.'</p>

<p>He continued his work while he talked, Armorel making no
reply, enacting the model with zeal.</p>

<p>'It is a strange sunset,' he went on, as if talking to himself,
'a day of clouds, but in the west a broad belt of blue low down in
the horizon: in the midst of the belt the sun flaming crimson: on
either hand the sky aglow, but only in the belt of clear: above is
the solid cloud, grey and sulky, receiving none of the colour: below
is also the solid, sulky cloud, but under the sun there spreads out
a fan of light which strikes the waters and sets them aflame in a
long broad road from the heavens to your feet, O child of Lyonesse.
Outside this road of light the waters are dull and gloomy: in the
sky the coloured belt of light fades gradually into soft yellows,
clear greens, and azure blues. A strange sunset! A strange effect
of light! Armorel, you see your life: it is prefigured by the light.
Overhead the sky is grey and colourless: where the glow of the
future does not lie on the waters they are grey and colourless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Nothing around you but the waste of grey sea: before you black
rocks&mdash;life is always full of black rocks: and beyond, the splendid
sun&mdash;soft, warm, and glowing. You shall interpret that in your
own way.'</p>

<p>Armorel listened, standing motionless, her left hand shading
her eyes.</p>

<p>'If the picture,' he went on, 'comes out as I hope it may, it
will be one of those that suggest many things. Every good picture,
Armorel, as well as every good poem, suggests. It is like
that statue of Christ which is always taller than the tallest man.
Nobody can ever get above the thought and soul of a good picture
or a good poem. There is always more in it than the wisest man
knows. That is the proof of genius. That is why I long all day
for the mysterious power of putting into my work the soul of
everyone who looks upon it&mdash;as well as my own soul. When you
come to stand before a great picture, Armorel, perhaps you will
understand what I mean. You will find your heart agitated with
strange emotions&mdash;you will leave it with new thoughts. When
you go away from your desert island, remember every day to read
a piece of great verse, to look upon a great picture, and to hear a
piece of great music. As for these suggested thoughts, you will
not perhaps be able to put them into words. But they will be
there.'</p>

<p>Still Armorel made no reply. It was as if he were talking to a
statue.</p>

<p>'I have painted you,' he said, 'with the golden torque round
your neck: the red gold is caught by the sunshine: as for your
dress, I think it must be a white woollen robe&mdash;perhaps a border
of purple&mdash;but I don't know&mdash;&mdash; There are already heaps of
colour&mdash;colour of sky and of water, of the granite with the yellow
lichen, and of brown and yellow fern and of heather faded&mdash;&mdash; No&mdash;you
shall be all in white, Armorel. No dress so sweet for a
girl as white. A vest of white linen made by yourself from your
own spinning-wheel, up to the throat and covering the right
shoulder. Are you tired, child?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;I like to hear you talk.'</p>

<p>'I have nearly done&mdash;in fact,' he leaned back and contemplated
his work with the enthusiasm which is to a painter what the glow
of composition is to the writer, 'I have done all I can until I go
home. The sun of Scilly hath a more golden glow in September
than the sun of St. John's Wood. If I have caught aright&mdash;or
something like it&mdash;the light that is around you and about you,
Armorel&mdash;&mdash; The sun in your left hand is like the red light of the
candle through the closed fingers. So&mdash;I can do no more&mdash;Armorel!
you are all glorious within and without. You are indeed
the King's Daughter: you are clothed with the sun as with a garment:
if the sun were to disappear this moment, you would stand
upon the Peak, for all the island to admire&mdash;a flaming beacon!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>His voice was jubilant&mdash;he had done well. Yet he shaded his
eyes and looked at canvas and at model once more with jealousy
and suspicion. If he had passed over something! It was an
ambitious picture&mdash;the most ambitious thing he had yet attempted.</p>

<p>'Armorel!' he cried. 'If I could only paint as well as I can
see! Come down, child; you are good indeed to stand so long
and so patiently.'</p>

<p>She obeyed and jumped off her eminence, and stood beside him
looking at the picture.</p>

<p>'Tell me what you think,' said the painter. 'You see&mdash;it is
the King's Daughter. She stands on a peak in Lyonesse and
looks forth upon the waters. Why? I know not. She seeks the
secrets of the future, perhaps. She looks for the coming of the
Perfect Knight, perhaps. She expects the Heaven that waits for
every maiden&mdash;in this world as well as in the next. Everyone
may interpret the picture for himself. She is young&mdash;everything
is possible to the young. Tell me, Armorel, what do you think?'</p>

<p>She drew a long breath. 'A&mdash;h!' she murmured. 'I have
never seen anything like this before. It is not me you have
painted, Roland. You say it is a picture of me&mdash;just to please
and flatter me. There is my face&mdash;yet not my face. All is
changed. Roland, when I am grown to my full height, shall I look
like this?</p>

<p>'If you do, when that day comes, I shall be proved to be a
painter indeed,' he replied. 'If you had seen nothing but yourself&mdash;your
own self&mdash;and no more, I would have burnt the thing.
Now you give me hopes.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Armorel loved best to remember him as he stood
there beside this unfinished picture, glowing with the thought that
he had done what he had attempted. The soul was there.</p>

<p>Out of the chatter of the studio, the endless discussions of style
and method, he had come down to this simple spot, to live for
three weeks, cut off from the world, with a child who knew
nothing of these things. He came at a time when his enthusiasm
for his work was at its fiercest: that is, when the early studies are
beginning to bear fruit, when the hand has acquired command of
the pencil and can control the brush, and when the eye is already
trained to colour. It was at a time when the young artist refuses
to look at any but the greatest work, and refuses to dream of any
future except that of the greatest and noblest work. It is a
splendid thing to have had, even for a short time, these dreams and
these enthusiasms.</p>

<p>'The picture is finished,' said Armorel, 'and to-morrow you
will go away and leave me.' The tears welled up in her eyes.
Why should not the child cry for the departure of this sweet
friend?</p>

<p>'My dear child,' he said, 'I cannot believe that you will stay
for ever on this desert island.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>'I do not want to leave the island. I want to keep you here.
Why don't you stay altogether, Roland? You can paint here.
Have we made you happy? Are you satisfied with our way of
living? We will change it for you, if you wish.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;it is not that. I must go home. I must go back
to my work. But I cannot bear to think of you left alone with
these old people, with no companions and no friends. The time
will come when you will leave the place and go away somewhere&mdash;where
people live and talk&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He reflected that if she went away it might be among people
ignorant of Art and void of culture. This beautiful child, who
might have been a Princess&mdash;she was only a flower-farmer of the
Scilly Islands. What could she hope or expect?</p>

<p>'I do not want to go into the world,' she went on. 'I am
afraid, because I am so ignorant. People would laugh at me. I
would rather stay here always, if you were with me. Then we
would do nothing but sail and row and go fishing: and you could
paint and sketch all the time.'</p>

<p>'It is impossible, Armorel. You talk like a child. In a year
or two you will understand that it is impossible. Besides, we
should both grow old. Think of that. Think of two old people going
about sailing among the islands for ever: I, like Justinian Tryeth,
bald and bowed and wrinkled: you, like Dorcas&mdash;no, no; you could
never grow like Dorcas: you shall grow serenely, beautifully old.'</p>

<p>'What would that matter?' she replied. 'Some day, even,
one of us would die. What would that matter, either, because we
should only be parted by a year or two? Oh! whether we are old
or young the sea never grows old, nor the hills and rocks&mdash;and the
sunshine is always the same. And when we die there will be a new
heaven and a new earth&mdash;you can read it in the Book of Revelation&mdash;but
no more sea, no more sea. That I cannot understand. How
could angels and saints be happy without the sea? If one lives
among people in towns, I dare say it may be disagreeable to grow
old, and perhaps to look ugly like poor Dorcas; but not, no, not
when one lives in such a place as this.'</p>

<p>'Where did you get your wisdom, Armorel?'</p>

<p>'Is that wisdom?'</p>

<p>'When I go away my chief regret will be that I kept talking
to you about myself. Men are selfish pigs. We should have
talked about nothing but you. Then I should have learned a great
deal. See how we miss our opportunities.'</p>

<p>'No, no; I had nothing to tell you. And you had such a great
deal to tell me. It was you who taught me that everybody ought
to try to grow to his full height.'</p>

<p>'Did I? It was only a passing thought. Such things occur
to one sometimes.'</p>

<p>She sat down on a boulder and crossed her hands in her lap,
looking at him seriously and gravely with her great black eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now,' she said, 'I want to be very serious. It is my last
chance. Roland, I am resolved that I will try to grow to my full
height. You are going away to-morrow, and I shall have no one
to advise me. Give me all the help you can before you go.'</p>

<p>'What help can I give you, Armorel?'</p>

<p>'I have been thinking. You have told me all about yourself.
You are going to be a great artist: you will give up all your life to
your work: when you have grown as tall as you can, everybody will
congratulate you, and you will be proud and happy. But who is
to tell me? How shall I know when I am grown to my full
height?'</p>

<p>'You have got something more in your mind, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'Give me a model, Roland. You always paint from a model
yourself&mdash;you told me so. Now, think of the very best actual girl
of all the girls you know&mdash;the most perfect girl, mind: she must
be a girl that I can remember and try to copy. I must have
something to think of and go by, you know.'</p>

<p>'The very best actual girl I know?' he laughed, with a touch
of the abominable modern cynicism which no longer believes in
girls. 'That wouldn't help you much, I am afraid. You see,
Armorel, I should not look to the actual girls I know for the best
girl at all. There is, however'&mdash;he pulled his shadowy moustache,
looking very wise&mdash;'a most wonderful girl&mdash;I confess that I have
never met her, but I have heard of her: the poets keep talking
about her&mdash;and some of the novelists are fond of drawing her; I
have heard of her, read of her, and dreamed of her. Shall I tell
you about her?'</p>

<p>'If you please&mdash;that is, if she can become my model.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. She is quite a possible girl, Armorel, like yourself.
That is to say, a girl who may really develop out of certain qualities.
As for actual girls, there are any number whom one knows in a
way&mdash;one can distinguish them&mdash;I mean by their voices, their
faces, and their figures and so forth. But as for knowing anything
more about them&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Tell me, then, about the girl whom you do know, though you
have never seen her.'</p>

<p>'I will if I can. As for her face&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Never mind her face,' she interrupted, impatiently.</p>

<p>'Never mind her face, as you say. Besides, you can look in
the glass if you want to know her face.'</p>

<p>'Yes; that will do,' said Armorel, simply. 'Now go on.'</p>

<p>'First of all, then, she is always well dressed&mdash;beautifully dressed&mdash;and
with as much taste as the silly fashion of the day allows. A
woman, you know, though she is the most beautiful creature in the
whole of animated nature, can never afford to do without the adornments
of dress. It does not much matter how a man goes dressed.
He only dresses for warmth. In any dress and in any rags a
handsome man looks well. But not a woman. Her dress either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ruins her beauty or it heightens it. A woman must always, and
at all ages, look as beautiful as she can. Therefore, she arranges
her clothes so as to set off her beauty when she is young: to make
her seem still beautiful when she is past her youth: and to hide
the ravages of time when she is old. That is the first thing which I
remark about this girl. Of course, she doesn't dress as if her father
was a Silver King. Such a simple stuff as your grey nun's cloth,
Armorel, is good enough to make the most lovely dress.'</p>

<p>'She is always well dressed,' his pupil repeated. 'That is the
first thing.'</p>

<p>'She is accomplished, of course,' Roland added, airily, as if
accomplishments were as easy to pick up as the blue and grey
shells on Porth Bay. 'She understands music, and plays on some
instrument. She knows about art of all kinds&mdash;art in painting,
sculptures, decorations, poetry, literature, music. She can talk
intelligently about art; and she has trained her eye so that
she knows good work. She is never carried away by shams and
humbug.'</p>

<p>'She has trained her eye, and knows good work,' Armorel
repeated.</p>

<p>'Above all, she is sympathetic. She does not talk so as to show
how clever she is, but to bring out the best points of the man she
is talking with. Yet when men leave her they forget what they
have said themselves, and only remember how much this girl seems
to know.'</p>

<p>'Seems to know?' Armorel looked up.</p>

<p>'One woman cannot know everything. But a clever woman
will know about everything that belongs to her own set. We all
belong to our own set, and every set talks its own language&mdash;scientific,
artistic, whatever it is. This girl does not pretend
to enter into the arena; but she knows the rules of the game,
and talks accordingly. She is always intelligent, gracious, and
sympathetic.'</p>

<p>'She is intelligent, gracious, and sympathetic,' Armorel repeated.
'Is she gracious to everybody&mdash;even to people she does not
like?'</p>

<p>'In society,' said Roland, 'we like everybody. We are all
perfectly well-bred and well-behaved: we always say the kindest
things about each other.'</p>

<p>'Now you are saying one thing and meaning another. That is
like your friend Dick Stephenson. Don't, Roland.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, I have very little more to say. This girl, however,
is always a woman's woman.'</p>

<p>'What is that?'</p>

<p>'Difficult to explain. A wise lady once advised me when I went
courting, first to make quite sure that the girl was a woman's
woman. I think she meant that other girls should speak and think
well of her. I haven't always remembered the advice, it is true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but&mdash;&mdash;' Here he stopped short and in some confusion, remembering
that this was not an occasion for plenary confession.</p>

<p>But Armorel only nodded gravely. 'I shall remember,' she
said.</p>

<p>'The rest you know. She loves everything that is beautiful
and good. She hates everything that is coarse and ugly. That is
all.'</p>

<p>'Thank you&mdash;I shall remember,' she repeated. 'Roland, you
must have thought a good deal about girls to know so much.'</p>

<p>He blushed: he really did. He blushed a rich and rosy red.</p>

<p>'An artist, you know,' he said, 'has to draw beautiful girls.
Naturally he thinks of the lovely soul behind the lovely face. These
things are only commonplaces. You yourself, Armorel&mdash;you&mdash;will
shame me, presently&mdash;when you have grown to that full height&mdash;for
drawing a picture so insufficient of the Perfect Woman.'</p>

<p>He stooped slightly, as if he would have kissed her forehead.
Why not? She was but a child. But he refrained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">

<span class="caption"><i>He stooped slightly, as if he would have kissed her
forehead.</i></span>
</div>

<p>'Let us go home,' he said, with a certain harshness in his voice.
'The sun is down. The clouds have covered up the belt of blue.
You have seen your splendid future, Armorel, and you are back
in the grey and sunless present. It grows cold. To-morrow, I
think, we may have rain. Let us go home, child: let us go home.'</p>

<small>MR. FLETCHER RETURNS FOR HIS BAG</small></h2>


<p>Half an hour later the blinds were down, the fire was brightly
burning, the red firelight was merrily dancing about the room, and
the table was pushed back. Then Dorcas and Justinian came in&mdash;the
two old serving-folk, bent with age, grey-headed, toothless&mdash;followed
by Chessun&mdash;thin and tall, silent and subdued. And
Armorel, taking her violin, tuned it, and turned to her old master
for instructions, just as she had done on the first and every following
night of Roland's stay.</p>

<p>'"Barley Break,"' said Justinian.</p>

<p>Armorel struck up that well-known air. Then, as before, the
ancient dame started, moved uneasily, sat upright, and opened her
eyes and began to talk. But to-night she was not rambling: she
did not begin one fragment of reminiscence and break off in the
middle. She started with a clear story in her mind, which she
began at the beginning and carried on. When Armorel saw her
thus disposed, she stopped playing 'Barley Break,' which may
amuse the aged mind and recall old merriment, but lacks
earnestness.</p>

<p>'"Put on thy smock o' Monday,"' said Justinian.</p>

<p>This ditty lends itself to more sustained thought. Armorel
put more seriousness into it than the theme of the music would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
seem to warrant. The old lady, however, seemed to like it, and
continued her narrative without interrupting it at any point.
Armorel also observed that, though she addressed the assembled
multitude generally, she kept glancing furtively at Roland.</p>

<p>'The night was terrible,' said the ancient dame, speaking
distinctly and connectedly; 'never was such a storm known&mdash;we
could hear the waves beating and dashing about the islands louder
than the roaring of the wind, and we heard the minute-gun, so that
there was little sleep for anyone. At daybreak we were all on the
shore, out on Shark Point. Sure enough, on the Castinicks the
ship lay, breaking up fast&mdash;a splendid East Indiaman she was.
Her masts were gone and her bows were stove in&mdash;as soon as the
light got strong enough we could see so much&mdash;and the shore
covered already with wreck. But not a sign of passengers or crew.
Then my husband's father, who was always first, saw something,
and ran into the water up to his middle and dragged ashore a spar.
And, sure enough, a man was lashed to the spar. When father
hauled the man up, he was quite senseless, and he seemed dead, so
that another quarter of an hour would have finished him, even if
his head had not been knocked against a rock, or the spar turned
over and drowned him. Just as father was going to call for help
to drag him up, he saw a little leather bag hanging from his neck
by a leather thong. There were others about, all the people of
Samson&mdash;fifty of them&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;all busy
collecting the things that had been washed ashore, and some up to
their waists in the water after the things still floating about. But
nobody was looking. Therefore, father, thinking it was a dead
man, whipped out his knife, cut the leather thong, and slipped the
bag into his own pocket, not stopping to look at it. No one saw
him, mind&mdash;no one&mdash;not even your father, Justinian, who was
close beside him at the time.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' said Justinian: 'if father had seen it, naturally&mdash;&mdash;'
But his voice died away, and Roland was left to wonder what, under
such circumstances, a native of Samson would have done.</p>

<p>'No one saw it. Father thought the man was dead. But he
wasn't. Presently he moved. Then they carried him up the hill
to the farm&mdash;this very house&mdash;and laid him down before the fire&mdash;just
at your feet, Armorel&mdash;and I was standing by. "Get him a
cordial," says father. So we gave him a dram, and he drank it
and opened his eyes. He was a gentleman&mdash;we could see that&mdash;not
a common sailor: not a common man.'</p>

<p>Here her head dropped, and she seemed to be losing herself
again.</p>

<p>'Try her with a Saraband,' said Justinian, as if a determined
effort had to be made. Armorel changed her tune. A Saraband
lends itself to a serious and even solemn turn of thought. As a
dance it requires the best manners, the bravest dress, and the most
dignified air. It will be seen, therefore, that to a mind bent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
a grave narrative of deeds lamentable and fateful, the Saraband,
played in a proper frame of mind, may prove sympathetic. The
ancient lady lifted her head, strengthened by the opening bars,
which, indeed, are very strong, and resumed her story. Armorel,
to be sure, and all her hearers, knew the history well, having heard
it every night in disjointed bits. The Tale of the Stolen Treasure
was familiar to her: it was more than familiar&mdash;it was a bore: the
Family Doom seemed unjust to her: it disturbed her sense of
Providential benevolence: yet she threw all her soul into the
Saraband in order to prolong by a few minutes the waking and
conscious moments of this remote ancestress. A striking illustration,
had the others understood it, of filial piety.</p>

<p>'But I was standing close by father,' she went on&mdash;'I was beside
him on the beach, and I saw it. I saw him cut the thong and slip
the bag into his pocket. When he came to himself, I whispered to
father, "There's his bag: you've got his bag in your pocket." "I
know," he said, rough. "Hold your tongue, girl." So I said no
more, but waited. Then the man opened his eyes and tried to sit
up; but he couldn't, being still dizzy with the beating of the
waves. But he looked at us, wondering where he was. "You are
ashore, Master," said father. "The only one of all the ship's company
that is, so far." "Ashore?" he asked. "Ay, ashore:
where else would you be? Your ship's in splinters: your captain
and your crew are dead men all. But you're ashore." With that
the man shut his eyes and lay quiet for a time. Then he opened
them again. "Where am I?" he asked. "You are on Samson,
in Scilly," I told him. Then he tried to get up again, but he
couldn't. And so we carried him upstairs and laid him on the bed.</p>

<p>'He was in bed for nigh upon six weeks. Never was any man
so near his latter end. I nursed him all the time. He had a fever,
and his head wandered. In his rambling he told me who he was.
His name was Robert Fletcher&mdash;Robert Fletcher,' she repeated,
nodding to Roland with strange significance. 'A brave gentleman,
and handsome and well-mannered. He had been in the service of
an Indian King; and, though he was only thirty, he had made his
fortune and was bringing it home, thinking that he would do nothing
more all his life but just sit down and enjoy himself. All his fortune
was in the bag. When he recovered he told me that the last
thing he remembered, before he was washed off the ship, was feeling
for the safety of his bag. And it was gone. And he was a
beggar. Poor man! And I knew all the time where the bag was
and who had it. But I could not tell him. If father sinned when
he kept the bag, I sinned as well, because I knew he kept it. If
father was punished when his son was drowned, that son was my
husband, and I was punished too.'</p>

<p>She stopped, and it seemed as if for the evening she had run
down; but Armorel stimulated her again, and she went on, looking
more and more at the face of the stranger that was in their gates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>'While he lay ill and was like to die, father was uneasy&mdash;I
know why. He wanted him to die, because then he could keep the
treasure with a quiet mind. "All's ours that comes ashore," that's
what we used to say. He never confessed his thoughts&mdash;but I,
who knew what was in the bag, guessed them very well.</p>

<p>'The stranger began to recover, and father fell into a gloomy
fit, and would go and sit by himself for hours. Nobody dared ask
him&mdash;for he was a man of short temper and rough in his speech&mdash;what
was the matter with him, but I knew very well. He was
gloomy because he didn't want to lose that bag. But the man got
better, and at last quite well, and one morning he came down
dressed in clothes that father lent him, because his own were ruined
in the washing of him ashore, and he bade us all farewell. "Captain
Rosevean," he said, very earnestly, "when I left India I was
rich: I was carrying all my fortune home with me in a small compass,
for safety, as I thought. I was going to be a rich man, and
work no more. Well&mdash;I have escaped with my life, and that is all.
If I were not a beggar I would offer you half my fortune for saving
my life. As it is, I can offer you nothing but my gratitude."</p>

<p>'So he shook hands with father, who stood as white as a sheet,
for all he was a ruddy-faced man and inclined to brandy. "And
farewell, Mistress Ursula," he said. "Farewell, my kind nurse."
So he kissed me, being a courteous gentleman. "I shall come
back again to see you," he said; "I shall surely come back. Look
to see me some day, when you least expect me." So he went away,
and they rowed him over to the Port, and he sailed to Penzance.
Father went to his own room, where the treasure was. And my
heart sank heavy as lead. The more I thought of the wickedness,
the heavier fell my heart. There was father and his son, my
husband, and myself and my own son not yet born. The Hand of
the Lord would be upon us for that wickedness. I ought to
have cried out to the stranger before he went away that his treasure
was safe and that we were keeping it for him. But I didn't.
Then I tried to comfort myself. I said that when he came again I
would give him back the bag, even if I had to steal it from father's
chest.</p>

<p>'It was a long time ago&mdash;they are all gone, swallowed up by the
sea&mdash;which was right, because we stole the treasure from the sea.
He never came back. I looked for him to come after my husband
was drowned, and after my son went too, and my grandson&mdash;but
he never came again as he promised. And at last, at last'&mdash;her
voice rose almost to a shriek, and everybody jumped in his chair;
but Armorel continued to play the Saraband slowly and with much
expression&mdash;'at last he has come back, and we are saved. All that
are left of us are saved. Armorel, my child, you are saved. Your
bones shall not lie rotting among the sea-weed: your flesh shall
not be devoured by crabs and conger-eels: you may sail without fear
among the islands. For he has kept his promise and has come back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she rose&mdash;she, who had not stood upon her feet for three
years&mdash;actually rose and stood up, or seemed to stand: the red
light, playing on her face, made her eyes shine like two balls of
fire. 'You,' she cried, pointing her long, skinny, finger at Roland.
'You! oh! you have come at last. You have suffered all that
innocent blood to be shed: but you have come at last.' She sank
back among her pillows, but her finger still pointed at the stranger.
'Sir,' she said now, with tremulous voice, 'you are welcome. Late
though it is, Mr. Fletcher, you are welcome. When you came a
day or two ago I wondered, being now very old and foolish, if it
was really you. Now I know. I remember, though it is nearly
eighty years ago. You are welcome again to Samson, Mr. Fletcher.
You find me changed, no doubt. I knew you would keep your
promise and come again, some time or other. As for you, I see
little change. You are dressed differently, and when you were
here last your hair was worn in another fashion. But you are no
older to look at. You are not changed at all by time. You would
not know me again. How should you? I suppose you knew&mdash;somebody
told you, perhaps&mdash;that the bag was safe after all. That
knowledge has kept you young. Nothing short of that knowledge
could have kept you young. I assure you, Sir, had I known where
to find you I would have taken the bag and its contents to you long,
long ago. And now you are come back in search of it.'</p>

<p>'It was eighty years ago!' Dorcas whispered to Chessun, shuddering.
'He must be more than a hundred!'</p>

<p>'A hundred years!' returned her daughter, with pallid cheeks.
'It isn't in nature. He looks no more than twenty. Mother, is
he a man and alive?'</p>

<p>'Pretend that you are Mr. Fletcher,' whispered Armorel. 'Do
not contradict her. Say something.'</p>

<p>'It is a long time ago,' said Roland. 'I should have kept my
promise much sooner. And as for that bag&mdash;you saved my life, you
know. Pray keep the bag. It has long been forgotten.'</p>

<p>'Keep the bag? Do you know what is in it? Do you know
what it is worth? That, Mr. Fletcher, is your politeness. We,
who have suffered so much from the possession of the bag, cannot
believe that you have forgotten it, because if we have suffered
for our guilt you must have suffered through that guilt. Else
there would be no justice. No justice at all unless you have
suffered too. Else all those lives have been wasted and thrown
away.'</p>

<p>The old lady spoke with the voice and firmness of a woman of
fifty. She looked strong: she sat up erect. Armorel played on,
now softly, now loudly. The serving-folk looked on open-mouthed:
the women with terror undisguised. Was this gentleman, so
young and so pleasant, none other than the man whose injury had
brought all these drownings upon the family? Nearly eighty years
ago that happened. Then, he must be a ghost! What else could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
he be? No human creature could come back after eighty years
still so young.</p>

<p>'When I said, Madam,' Roland explained, 'that I had forgotten
the bag, what I meant was that after losing it so long I had quite
abandoned all hope of finding it again. I assure you that I have
not come here in search of it. In fact, I thought it was lying at
the bottom of the sea, where so many other treasures lie.'</p>

<p>'It is not at the bottom of the sea, Mr. Fletcher. You shall
have it again, to-morrow. You are still so young that you can
enjoy your fortune. Make good use of it, Sir, and do not forget
the poor. I have counted the contents again and again. They
are not things that wear out and rust, are they? No, no. You
must often have laughed to think that the moth and the worm cannot
destroy that treasure. You will be very pleased to have it
back.'</p>

<p>'I shall be very pleased indeed,' he echoed, 'to have my treasure
again.'</p>

<p>'Face and voice unchanged.' The old lady shook her head.
'And after eighty years. It is a miracle, yet not a greater miracle
than the Vengeance which has pursued this house so long. This
single crime has been visited upon the third and fourth generation.
'Tis time that punishment should cease at last&mdash;cease at last! I
must tell you, Mr. Fletcher,' she went on, 'that when my husband
was drowned and my father-in-law died, I took possession of the
bag and everything else. I said nothing to my son. Why?
Because, until the owner of the stolen bag came back, the curse
was on him and his children. No&mdash;no; I would not let him know.
But I knew very well what would happen to all of them. Oh!
yes; I knew, and I waited. But he was happy, and his son and
his grandson and his great-grandson, until they were drowned, one
after the other. And still you stayed away.'</p>

<p>'Madam, had I known, I would have returned fifty years ago
and more, in time to have saved them all.'</p>

<p>'You might have come sooner, Sir, permit me to say, and so
have saved some.' It was wonderful how erect the old lady held
herself, and with what firmness and precision she spoke.</p>

<p>'There is now only one left&mdash;the child Armorel. To-morrow,
Sir, you shall have your bag again. Once more you are our guest:
this time, I hope you will leave a blessing instead of a curse upon
the house.'</p>

<p>At this moment Armorel ceased playing. Then this ancient
lady stopped talking. She looked round: her eyes lost their fire:
her face its expression: her mouth its firmness: she fell back in
her pillows, and her head dropped.</p>

<p>Dorcas and Chessun rose and carried her to her own room.
The old man got up, too, and shambled out. Armorel pushed the
table into its place, and lit the candles. The incident was closed.
In the morning the old lady had forgotten everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>'Almost,' said Roland, 'she has made me believe that my name
is Fletcher. Shall I to-morrow morning ask her for the bag?
Where is that bag? Armorel, it is a true story. I am quite certain
of it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, it is true. Justinian knows about the wreck, though
it happened before he was born. Mr. Fletcher was the only man
saved of all the ship and company&mdash;captain, officers, crew, and
passengers&mdash;the only one. He was rescued by Captain Rosevean
himself and brought here. He had the bedroom where you sleep&mdash;the
bedroom which was my brother Emanuel's room. Here he lay
ill a long time, but recovered and went away.'</p>

<p>'And the bag?'</p>

<p>'I know nothing about the bag. That has gone long ago, I
suppose, with all the money that my people made by smuggling
and by piloting. I have seen her watching you for some days
past: I thought she would speak to you last night. To-morrow
she will have forgotten everything.'</p>

<p>'I suppose I have some kind of resemblance to Mr. Robert
Fletcher, presumably deceased. Well&mdash;but, Armorel, this is a
fortunate evening. The family luck has come back&mdash;I have brought
it back. The Ancient one said so, and you are saved. She may
call me Fletcher&mdash;call me Tryeth&mdash;call me any name that flyeth&mdash;if
she only calls me him who arrived in time to save you, Armorel.'</p>

<small>ROLAND'S LETTER</small></h2>


<p>Roland went away. Like Mr. Robert Fletcher, he promised to
return, and, like her great-great-grandmother, but for other reasons,
Armorel treasured this promise. Also like Mr. Robert Fletcher,
now presumably deceased, Roland went away with the sense of
having left something behind him. Not his heart, dear reader.
A young man of twenty-one does not give away his heart in the
old-fashioned way any longer: he carries it about with him, carefully
kept in its proper place: what Roland had left behind him, for
awhile, was a part of himself. It would perhaps come back to
him in good time, but for the present it remained on Samson, and
discoursed to the rest of him in London whenever he would listen,
on the beauties of that archipelago and the graces of the child
Armorel. And this part of himself, which haunted Samson, made
him sit down and write a letter. It would have been a tender, a
sorrowful, an affectionate letter had it not been for that other part
of him&mdash;the greater part&mdash;which went to London. That other
part of him remonstrated. 'She is but a simple country girl,' it
said. 'Her future will be to marry a simple Scillonian. Why disturb
her mind? Why seek to plant the seeds of discontent under
the guise of culture? Leave her&mdash;leave her to herself. Forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
those dark eyes, in whose depths there seemed to lie so sweet, so
great a soul. Believe me, there was nothing at all behind those
eyes but ignorance and curiosity. How could there be anything?
Leave her in peace. Or, since you must write, let it be a cold
letter&mdash;friendly, but fatherly&mdash;and let her understand clearly that
the visit can produce no further consequences whatever.' Thus
the London half of him&mdash;the bigger half. Perhaps his friend Dick
Stephenson remonstrated in the same strain. But the lesser half
insisted on writing a letter of some kind&mdash;and had his way.</p>

<p>He wrote a letter, and sent it off.</p>

<p>It was the very first letter that had ever been sent to Samson.
Of that I am quite sure. No letters ever reached that island. If
people had business with Samson, they transacted it at the Port
with Justinian or Peter. Of course it was the first letter that had
ever been received by Armorel. Peter brought it across for her.
He had wrapped the unaccustomed thing in brown paper for fear
the spray should fall upon it. Armorel drew it forth from its
covering and gazed upon it with the wonder of a child who gets an
unexpected toy. She read over the address a dozen times: '"Miss
Rosevean"&mdash;look at it, Dorcas. What a pity you cannot read!
"Miss Rosevean"&mdash;he might have written "Armorel"&mdash;"Island
of Samson, Scilly." Of course, it is from Roland. No one else
would write to me.' Then she opened it carefully, so as not to
injure any part of the writing&mdash;indeed, Roland possessed that
desirable, but very rare, gift of a very beautiful hand. No Penman
of the monastery: no scrivener of a later age: no Arab or Persian
scribe, could write a more beautiful hand. It was a hand in which
every letter was clearly formed, as if it made a picture of itself,
and every word was a Group, like the Eastern Isles of Scilly, to be
admired by the whole world.</p>

<p>The letter began&mdash;the London portion conceding so much&mdash;with
a pen-and-ink sketch of the writer's head: if it was just a little
idealised, who shall blame the limner? This was delightful.
Armorel had no portrait of her friend. What would follow after
such a beautiful beginning? Then the writing began, and Armorel
addressed herself seriously to the mastering of and the meaning of
the letter. I blush to record the fact, but Armorel read handwriting
slowly. Consider. Since she left school she had seen
none: while at school she had seen little. People easily forget such
a simple thing, though we who write all day long cannot understand
how a man can forget how to write. Yet there are many working-men
who cannot read handwriting, nor can they themselves write.
They have had no occasion, all their lives, to use either accomplishment,
and so have readily forgotten it&mdash;a fact which shows the
profound wisdom of the School Boards in teaching spelling.
Armorel could read the letter, but she read it slowly.</p>

<p>It seemed, when she read it first, sentence by sentence, a really
beautiful letter&mdash;regarded as a letter in the abstract. After she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
had read it two or three times over, and had mastered the whole
document, she began to understand that the writer of it was not
the man she remembered, not the man whose memory she loved
and cherished, not at all her friend Roland Lee. All the old
<i>camaraderie</i> was gone. It was the letter of another man altogether.
It was cold and stiff. The coldness went to the girl's heart. She
had never known Roland to be cold. Where was the sympathy
which formerly flowed in magnetic currents from one to the other?
Where was the brotherly interest?&mdash;she called it brotherly. The
writer spoke, it is true, with gratitude overwhelming, of his stay
on the island, and her hospitality. But, good gracious! Armorel
wanted no thanks. His visit had made her happy: he knew that.
Why should he take up a page and a half in returning thanks to
her, when her own heart was full of gratitude to him? He said
that the three weeks he had spent among the islands had been a
holiday which he could never forget&mdash;this was very good, so far;
but then he spoiled all by adding that he should not readily
forget&mdash;'readily forget' he wrote&mdash;his fair companion and guide
among those labyrinthine waters. 'Fair companion!' What
had fairness to do with it? Armorel had been his pupil: he
taught her all day long. She did not want to be called his 'fair
companion': that was mockery. She wanted to be called 'his dear
friend' or 'his dear sister': that would have gone straight to
her heart. She expected at least so much when she opened the
letter. But worse&mdash;far worse&mdash;was to follow. He actually spoke
of the possibilities of their never meeting again, the world (outside
Scilly) being so very wide. Never to meet again! And he
had promised to return: he had faithfully promised. Why,
he had only to take the steamer from Penzance: Samson Island
would not sail away. Why did he not rather say when he was to
be expected? Worst of all, he spoke of her forgetting him. Oh!
how could she forget him? As for the rest of the letter, the paternal
advice to continue in the path of industry, and so forth, no
clergyman in the pulpit could speak more wisely: but these things
touched not the girl. Woman wants affection rather than wisdom,
even though she understands, or has, at least, been told, that
Wisdom delivereth from the way of the Evil Man.</p>

<p>Armorel at length laid the letter down with a sigh and a tear.
She kept it in her pocket for some days, and read it every day:
but with increasing sadness. Finally, she laid it in a drawer where
were all the sketches, fragments of illustration, and outline drawings
which Roland had given her. She would read it no longer.
She would wait till Roland came back, and she would ask him what
it meant. Perhaps it was the way of the world to be so cold and
so constrained in letter-writing.</p>

<p>There came a box with the letter. It contained books&mdash;quite a
large number of books&mdash;selected by Roland with the view of suiting
the case of one who dwells upon a desert island. It was just as if
Captain Woodes Rogers had left Alexander alone upon Juan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Fernandez, and gone home to make up for him a parcel of books
intended to show him what went on in the wider world. There
were also drawing materials, colours, brushes, pencils, books of
instruction, and books of music. Roland the fatherly&mdash;the London
part of Roland&mdash;neglected nothing that might be solidly serviceable
to the young Person. Observe, here, one of those black gaps of
ignorance already spoken of in this girl of the Lonely Isles. She
did not know that an answer to the letter was absolutely necessary.
In the London studio the writer sat wondering why no answer
came. He had been so careful, too: not a word which could be
misunderstood: he had been so truly fatherly. And yet no reply.</p>

<p>Nobody was at hand to tell Armorel that she must sit down and
write some kind of an answer. She tried, in fact: she made several
attempts. But she could not write anything that satisfied her.
The coldness of the letter chilled her. She wanted to write as she
had talked with him&mdash;all out of the fulness of her heart. How
could she write to this frigid creature? The writer of such a letter
could not be her dear companion who laughed and made her laugh,
sang and made her sing, made pictures for her, told her all about
his own private ambitions, and had no secrets from her: it was a
strange man who wrote to her and signed the name of Roland Lee.
The real Roland would never have hinted at the possibility of her
forgetting him, or at the chance of their never meeting again. The
real Roland would have written to say when he was coming again.
She could not reply to this impostor.</p>

<p>Therefore, she never answered that letter at all; and so she got
no more letters. It was a pity, because, had she written what was
in her mind, for very pity the real Roland would have returned to
her. Once, and once only, the voice of Roland came to her across
the sea&mdash;and then it was a changed voice. He spoke no more.
But he would come again: he said he would come again. Every
day she sat on the hill beside the barrow, and gazed across the
Road. She could see the pier of Hugh Town and the vessels in the
port: perhaps Roland had come over from Penzance by the morning
steamer, and would shortly sail across the Road, and leap out upon
the beach, and run to meet and greet her, with both hands outstretched,
the light of affection in his eyes, and the laugh of welcome
in his voice. She was graver and more silent than before: she did
not sing so often as she walked among the ferns: she did not
prattle to Chessun and Dorcas while she made her cakes and
puddings. But nobody noticed any change in her: the serving-women,
if they observed any, would have said only that Armorel
was growing into a woman already.</p>

<p>The autumn changed to winter. Roland would not come in
winter, when the sea is stormy and there is little sunshine.
She must wait now until spring. Meantime, on Samson, where
are no trees except those wizened and crooked little trees of the
orchard, there is not much to mark the winter except the cold
wind and the short days. Here there is never frost or snow, hail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
or ice. The brown turf is much the same in December as in
August; the dead fern is not so yellow; the dead and dying leaves
of the bramble are not so splendid. The wind is colder, the sky
is more grey; otherwise winter makes little difference in the
external aspect of this archipelago. When the short days begin, the
brown fields of the flower-farms clothe themselves with the verdure
of spring: before the New Year has fairly set in, some of the fresh
delicate flowers have been already cut and laid in the hothouse to
be sent across to Covent Garden. The harvest of the year begins
with its first day, and they reap it from January to May.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things on such a farm for a girl to do.
Armorel did not, if you please, sit down to weep. But she daily
recalled with tender regret every one of the pleasant days of that
companionship. She kept her promise, too: she read something
every morning in the books which Roland had sent her: every
afternoon she attempted to carry on the drawing lesson by herself:
she practised her violin diligently: and every evening she played
the old tunes to the old lady, and awakened her once more to life
and memory. There was no change, except that everything now
was coloured by what he had said. She was to grow to her full
height&mdash;he had told her how&mdash;but at present she hardly saw her
way to carrying out those instructions. Her full height! Ignorant
of the truth&mdash;since such a girl grown to her full height would be
so tall as to be out of all proportion, not only to Samson, but even
to St. Mary's itself.</p>

<p>Sometimes one falls into the habit of associating a single person
with an idea, a thought, an anticipation, a place. Whenever the
mind turns to this thought, the person is present. For example,
there is a street in London which I have learned, from long habit,
to associate with a second-hand bookseller. He was a gentle creature,
full of reading, who had known many men. I sometimes sat
at the back of his shop conversing with him. Sometimes a twelve-month
would pass without my seeing him at all. But always when
I think of this street I think of this old gentleman. The other
day I passed through it. Alas! the shutters were up: the house
was to let: my gentle friend was gone. Armorel associated her
future&mdash;the unknown future&mdash;with Roland. Suppose that when
that future should be the present she should find the shutters up,
the house deserted, the tenant dead!</p>

<p>The harvest of flowers was well begun: the boxes piled in the
hold of the steamer merrily danced in the roll of the Atlantic waves
as the <i>Lady of the Isles</i> made her way to Penzance: in London the
delicate narcissus and the jonquil returned to the dinner-tables,
and stood about in glasses. Roland Lee bought them and took
them home to his studio, where he sat looking at them, reminded
of Armorel&mdash;who had never even answered his letter. Perhaps
the flowers came from Samson. Why did the girl send him no
answer to his letter? Then his memory went back to that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
island with its two hills, and its barrows, and the quiet house&mdash;and
to the girl who lived there. On what rock of Samson was she
sitting? Where was she at that moment? Gazing somewhere over
the wild waste of waters, the wind blowing about her curls, and
the beating of the waves in her ears. She had forgotten him.
Why not? He was only a visitor of a week or two. She was
nothing but a child&mdash;and an ignorant farmer-girl living in a desert
island. Ignorant? No; that was not the word. He saw her
once more standing in the middle of the room, the ruddy firelight
in her eyes and on her cheeks, playing 'Singleton's Slip' and
'Prince Rupert's March,' while the Ancient Lady mopped and
mowed and discoursed of other days. And again: he saw her
standing on the beach when he said farewell, the tears in her eyes,
her voice choked. Then he longed again, as he had longed then,
to take her in his arms, even in the presence of Peter the boy, to
soothe and kiss her and bid her weep no more, because he would
never, never leave her.</p>

<p>So strong was the impression made upon this young man by
this child of fifteen, that after six months spent in the society of
many other girls, of charms more matured, he still remembered
her, and thought of her with that kind of yearning regret which is
perilously akin to love. An untaught, ignorant girl&mdash;whose charm
lay in her innocent confidence, her soft black eyes, and the beauty
of the maiden emerging from the child&mdash;could hardly make a permanent
impression on a man of the world, even a young man of
only twenty-one. The time would go on, and the girl would be
forgotten, except as a pleasant memory associated with a delightful
holiday. An artist is, perhaps, above his fellows, liable to swift
and sudden changes; his mind dwells continually on beauty. All
lovely girls have not black hair and black eyes. Apollo, himself,
the god of artists, loved not only all the nine Muses and all the
three Graces, but a good many nymphs and princesses as well&mdash;such
is the artistic temperament, so catholic is its admiration of
beauty.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE CHANGE</small></h2>


<p>'A change,' said Roland, 'will surely come, and that before long.
I cannot believe'&mdash;Armorel remembered the words afterwards&mdash;'that
you will stay on this island for ever.' It needed no unusual
gift of prophecy to foretell impending change when the most
important member of the household was nearing her hundredth
year.</p>

<p>The change foretold actually came in April, when the flower-fields
had lost their beauty and the harvest of Scilly was nearly
over. Late blossoms of daffodil still reared their heads among the
thick leaves, though their blooming companions had all been cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
off to grace London tables; there were broad patches of wallflower
little regarded; the leaves of the bulbs were drooping and already
turning brown: these were the signs of approaching summer to the
Scillonian, who has already had his spring. On the adjacent
island of Great Britain the primrose clustered on the banks; the
hedges of the West Country were splendid, putting forth tender
leaves over a wealth of wild flowers; the chestnut-buds were swollen
and sticky, ready to burst. Do we not know the signs and tokens
of coming spring? On Scilly, the lengthening day&mdash;there are no
hedges and no trees to speak of&mdash;the completion of the flower
harvest, and the drooping of the daffodil-leaves in the fields are
the chief signs of spring. Yet there are other signs: if there are no
woods to show the tender leaf of spring, there are the green shoots
of the fern on the down: and there are the birds. The puffin has
already come back; he comes in his thousands: he arrives in April,
and he departs in September: whence he cometh and whither he
goeth no man hath ever learned nor can naturalist discover. At the
same time comes the guillemot, and sometimes the solan-goose:
the tern and the sheerwater come too, if they come at all, in
spring: but the wild ducks and the wild geese depart before the
flower-harvest is finished.</p>

<p>Armorel got up one morning in April a little earlier than usual.
It was five o'clock: the sun was rising over Telegraph Hill on
St. Mary's. She ran down the stairs, opened the door, and stood
on the porch drawing a deep breath. No one was as yet stirring
on Samson, though I think Peter was beginning to turn in his bed.
Out at sea Armorel saw a great steamer, homeward bound, perhaps
an Australian liner: the level rays of the early sun shone on her
spars and made them stand out clear and fine against the sky:
behind her streamed her long white cloud of smoke and steam,
hanging over the water, light and feathery. There were no other
ships visible. The air was cold, but the sun of April was already
strong. Armorel shivered, caught her hat, and ran over the hill,
singing as she went, not knowing that in the night, while she
slept, the Angel of Death had visited the house.</p>

<p>About seven o'clock she came back, having completely circumnavigated
the island of Samson, and made, as usual, many curious
observations and discoveries in the manners and customs of puffins,
terns, and shags. She returned in the cheerful mood which
belongs to youth, health, and readiness for breakfast. She instantly
perceived, however, on arriving, that something had happened&mdash;something
unusual. For Peter stood in the porch: what was
Peter doing in the porch at seven o'clock in the morning, when he
ought to have been ministering to the pigs? Further, Peter was
standing in the attitude of a boy who waits to be sent on an errand.
It is an attitude of expectant readiness&mdash;of zeal according to duty&mdash;of
activity bought and freely rendered. You will observe this
attitude in all office boys&mdash;except telegraph-boys: they never assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it: they affect no zeal: they betray no eagerness to put in a
fair day's work. Such an attitude would lack the dignity due to a
Government officer. And at sight of Armorel Peter hung his
head as one who sorrows, or is ashamed or repentant. What did
he do that for? What had happened? Why should he hang his head?</p>

<p>She asked these questions of Peter, who only shook his head
and pointed within. She heard Justinian's voice giving some
directions. She also heard Dorcas and Chessun. They were all
three speaking in low voices. She hurried in. The door of the
old lady's bedroom&mdash;that sacred apartment into which no one,
except the two handmaidens, had ever ventured&mdash;stood wide open;
not only that, but Justinian himself was in the room&mdash;actually in
the room&mdash;and beside the bed. Then Armorel understood what
had happened. On no other condition would Justinian be admitted
to his old mistress's room. On the other side of the bed stood
Dorcas and Chessun. Seeing Armorel at the door, these two ladies
instantly lifted up their voices and wailed aloud&mdash;nay, they shrieked
and screamed their lamentations, as if it was the first time in the
world's history that death had carried off an aged woman. This
they did by a kind of instinct: the thing, though they knew it not,
was a survival. In ancient times it was the custom in Lyonesse
that the women should all wail and weep and shriek, and beat their
breasts and tear their hair, and cut their cheeks with their nails,
while the body of the dead king or warrior was carried up the slope
of the hill to be laid in its kistvaen and covered with its barrow on
Samson island.</p>

<p>They wailed aloud, then, because it had always been the right
thing for the women of Samson to do. Otherwise, when one so
ancient dies at last, mind and memory gone before, what place is
there for wailing and weeping? One natural tear we drop, for all
must die; but grief belongs to the death-bed of the young. There
needed no shriek of the women nor anyone's speech to tell Armorel
that the white face upturned on the bed was not the face of a
living woman. They had folded the dead hands across her breast:
the eyes were closed: the countless wrinkles of the aged face were
smoothed out: the lips were parted with a wan smile. After many,
many years, Ursula, the widow, was gone to rejoin her husband.
Pray Heaven her desire be granted, and that she rise again young
and beautiful&mdash;such a woman as that ill-starred sailor, dragged to
the bottom of the sea by the weight of Robert Fletcher's bag, had
loved in life!</p>

<p>Peter presently sailed across the Road, and returned with the
doctor. It is the part of the doctor not only to usher the new-born
into life, but to bar or open the gates of the tomb: without him
very few of us die, and without him no one can be buried. This
man of science graciously expressed his willingness to acknowledge,
though he had not been called in, that the deceased died of old
age. Then he went back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening there was no music. The violin remained in its
place; the great chair was empty; no one brought out the spinning-wheel;
the table was not pushed back. How was the long evening
to be got through without the violin? How could those ancient
tunes be played any more in the presence of that empty chair?
When the serving-folk came in as usual and sat round the fire, and
the women sighed and moaned, and Justinian stimulated the coals
to a flame, and the ruddy light played upon their faces, Armorel
began to think that a continuance of these evenings would be
tedious. Then they began to talk, the conversation naturally
turning on Death and Judgment, and the prospects of Heaven and
the departed.</p>

<p>'She was not one of them,' said Dorcas, 'as would never talk
of such things. I've often heard her say she wanted to rise again,
young and beautiful, same as she was when her husband was took,
so that he should love her again.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Justinian; 'that's foolish talk. There's neither
marrying nor giving in marriage there. You ought to know so
much, Dorcas. Husbands and wives will know each other, I doubt
not, if it's only for the man's forgiveness after the many crosses
and rubs. 'Twould be a pity, wife, if we didn't know each other,
golden crown and all. I'd be sorry to think you were not about
somewhere.'</p>

<p>Armorel listened without much interest. She wondered vaguely
how Dorcas would look in a golden crown, and hoped that she
might not laugh when she should be permitted to gaze upon her
thus wonderfully adorned. Then she listened in silence while these
thinkers followed up their speculations on the next world and the
decrees of Heaven, with the freedom of their kind. A strangely
brutal freedom! It consigns, without a thought of pity, the majority
of mankind to a doom which they are too ignorant to realise
and too stupid to understand. The deceased lady, it was agreed,
might, perhaps&mdash;though this was by no means certain&mdash;have fallen
under Conviction of Sin at some remote period, before any of them
knew her. Not since, that was certain. And as for her husband,
he was cut off in his sins&mdash;like all the Roseveans, struck down in
his sins, without a warning. So that if the old lady expected to
meet him, after their separation of nearly eighty years, on the
Shores of Everlasting Praise, she would certainly be disappointed,
because he was otherwise situated and disposed of. Therefore she
might just as well go up old and wrinkled. This kind of talk was
quite familiar to Armorel, and generally meant nothing to her.
The right of private judgment is claimed and freely exercised in
Scilly, where that branch of the Church Catholic called Bryanite
greatly flourishes. Formerly, she would have passed over this talk
without heeding. Now, she had begun to think of these as well
as of many other things. Roland's words on religious things startled
her into thinking. She listened, therefore, wondering what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
view people like Roland Lee would take of her great-grandfather's
present condition, and of the poor old lady's prospects of meeting
him again. Then her thoughts wandered from these nebulous
speculations, and she heard no more, though the conversation
became lurid with the flames of Tartarus, and these old religioners
gloated over the hopeless sufferings of the condemned. A sweet and
holy thing, indeed, has mankind made of the Gospel of Great Joy!</p>

<p>Before they separated, Chessun rose and left the room noiselessly.
Armorel had no experience of the situation, but she knew
that something was going to be done, something connected with
the impending funeral&mdash;something solemn.</p>

<p>In fact, Chessun returned after ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour, the others making a pretence of expecting nothing. Doctrinal
meditation was written on Justinian's brow: resignation on
that of Dorcas. Chessun bore in her hands a tray with glasses and
a silver tankard filled with something that steamed. It was a
posset, made with biscuits, new milk and sherry, nutmeg and
sugar&mdash;an emotional drink, strong, sweet, comforting, very good
for mournful occasions, but, of late years, unfortunately, gone out
of fashion.</p>

<p>They all had a glass, the two women moaning over their glasses,
and the old man shaking his head. Then they went to bed.</p>

<p>They had a posset every night until the funeral. They buried
the ancient dame on Bryher. A boat carried the coffin across the
water to the landing-place in New Grinsey Sound, behind which
stands the little old church with its churchyard. Armorel and her
household followed in one of the family boats, as in a mourning-carriage.
All the people of Tresco and Bryher were present at the
funeral; and most of them came across to Samson after the ceremony
to drink a glass of wine and eat a slice of cake, the women
no longer wailing and the men no longer shaking their heads.</p>

<p>All the Roseveans who have escaped the vengeance of Mr.
Fletcher's terrible bag lie in Bryher churchyard. They are mostly
widows, poor things! They sleep alone, because their husbands' bones
lie about among the tall weeds in the tranquil depths of the ocean.</p>

<p>And Armorel, looking forward, thought with terror of the long,
silent evenings, while the old serving-folk would sit round in the
firelight, silent, or saying things that might as well have been left
unsaid.</p>

<small>ARMOREL'S INHERITANCE</small></h2>


<p>'You are now the mistress, dearie,' said Dorcas. 'It is time that
you should learn what that means.'</p>

<p>It was the morning after the funeral&mdash;the Day of Accession&mdash;the
beginning of the new reign.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why, Dorcas, it makes no difference, does it? There are still
the flowers and the house and everything.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;there's everything.' The old woman nodded her head
meaningly. 'Oh! yes&mdash;there is everything. Oh! you don't
know&mdash;you don't suspect&mdash;nobody knows&mdash;what a surprise is in
store for you!'</p>

<p>'What surprise, Dorcas?'</p>

<p>'You've never been into her room except to see her lying dead.
It's your room now. You can go in whenever you like. Always
the master or the mistress has slept in that room. When her
father-in-law died she took the room. And she's slept in it ever
since. And no one, except me and Chessun to clean up and sweep
and dust, has ever been in that room since. And now it's yours.'</p>

<p>'Well, Dorcas, it may be mine; but I shall go on sleeping in my
own room.'</p>

<p>'Then keep it locked&mdash;keep it locked up&mdash;day and night.
There's nobody in Samson to dread&mdash;but keep it locked! As for
sleeping in it, time enough, perhaps, when you come to marry.
But keep it locked&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why, Dorcas, what is in it?'</p>

<p>'I am seventy-five years old and past,' Dorcas went on. 'I
was fifteen when I came to the house, and here I've been ever
since. Not one of the grandchildren nor the great-grandchildren
ever came in here. No one ever knew what is kept here.'</p>

<p>'What is it, then?' Armorel asked again.</p>

<p>'She used to come here alone, by daylight, regularly once a
month. She locked the door when she came in. No one ever
knew what she was doing, and no one ever asked. One day she
forgot to lock the door, and by accident I opened it, and saw what
she was doing.'</p>

<p>'What was she doing?'</p>

<p>'She'd opened all the cupboards and boxes, and she'd spread
out all the things, and was counting, and&mdash;no, no&mdash;you may guess,
when you have looked for yourself, what she was doing. I shut
the door softly, and she never knew that I'd looked in upon her.
She might have been overseen from the orchard, but no one ever
went in there except to gather the fruit. To make safe, however,
I've put up a muslin blind now, because Peter might take it into
his head&mdash;boys go everywhere peering and prying. Nobody knows
what I saw. I never even told Justinian. Men blab, you see:
they get together, and they drink&mdash;then they blab. You can never
trust a man with a secret. How long would it be before Peter
would let it out if he knew? Once over at Hugh Town, drinking
at a bar, and all the world would know in half an hour. No,
no; the secret was hers: it was mine as well&mdash;but that was an
accident&mdash;she never knew that: now it will be yours and mine.
And we will tell nobody&mdash;nobody at all.'</p>

<p>'Where shall I find this wonderful secret, Dorcas?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>'Wherever you look, dearie. Oh! the room is full of things.
There can't be such another room in all the world. It's crammed
with things. Look everywhere. If they knew, all the young lords
and princes would be at your feet, Armorel, because you are so
rich. Best keep it secret, though, and get richer.'</p>

<p>'I so rich? Dorcas, you are joking!'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;you shall look and find out. Not that you will understand
at first&mdash;because, how should you know the value of things?
Here's her bunch of keys. She always carried them in her pocket,
and at night she kept them under her pillows&mdash;and there I found
them, sure enough, when she was cold and dead. Take them,
child. I never told her secret&mdash;no&mdash;not even to my own husband.
Take the keys, child. They are yours&mdash;your own. You can open
everything: you can look at everything: you can do what you like
with everything. It's your inheritance. But tell no one,' she
repeated, earnestly. 'Oh! my dear, let it remain a secret. Don't
let anyone see you when you come in here. Lock the door, as she
did&mdash;and keep it locked.'</p>

<p>The old woman led Armorel by the hand to the door of the
room where there was to be found the Great Surprise. She opened
it, placed a bunch of keys in her hand, pushed her in and closed
it behind her, whispering, 'Lock it, and keep it locked.'</p>

<p>The girl turned the key obediently, wondering what would
happen next.</p>

<p>The room was on the ground floor, looking out upon the
orchard, with a northern aspect, so that the sun could only shine
in for a small portion of the year, during the summer months.
The apple-trees were now in blossom, the white pink and flowers
bright in the sunshine contrasting with the grey lichen which
wrapped every branch and hung down like ribbons. The room
was the oldest part of the house, the only remaining portion of
an earlier house: it was low and small: the fireplace had never
been modernised: it stood wide open, with its dogs and its broad
chimney: the window was of three narrow lights, one of which
could be opened: all were still provided with the old diamond
panes in their leaden setting. Armorel observed the muslin blind
put up by Dorcas to keep out prying eyes. In dull and cloudy
days the room would be gloomy. As it was, even with the bright
sunshine out of doors, the air seemed cold and oppressive&mdash;perhaps
from the fresh association of Death. Armorel shivered as she
looked about her.</p>

<p>The greater part of the room was taken up by a large bed. In
the old lady's time it had curtains and a head, and things at the
four corners like the plumes of a hearse, but in faded crimson.
Then it looked splendid. Now, the bed had been stripped:
curtains and plumes and all were gone, and only the skeleton bed
left, with its four great solid posts and its upper beams, and its
feather bed lying exposed, with the bare pillow-cases upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
mattress. But the bedstead was magnificent without its trappings,
because it was made of mahogany black with age: they no longer
make such bedsteads. There was also a table&mdash;an old black table&mdash;with
massive legs; but there was nothing on it.</p>

<p>Between door and wall there was a row of pegs, with a chair
beneath them. Now, by some freak of chance, when Dorcas and
Chessun hung up the ancient dame's things for the last time&mdash;her
great bonnet, and the cap of many ribbons within it, and her silk
dress&mdash;they arranged them so as to present a most extraordinary
presentment of the venerable lady herself&mdash;much elongated and
without any face: she seemed to be sitting in the chair below the
pegs, dressed as usual, and nodding her great bonnet, but pulled
out to eight or ten feet in length. Armorel caught the ghostly
similitude and started, trembling. It seemed as if in a moment
the wrinkled old face, with the hawk-like nose and the keen eyes,
would come back to the bonnet and the cap. She was so much
startled that she turned the bonnet round. And then the figure
seemed watching with the shoulders. This was uncanny, but it
was not so terrible as the faceless form.</p>

<p>Beside the fireplace was a cupboard&mdash;one of those huge cupboards
which one only finds in the old houses. Armorel tried the
door, but it was locked. Against the wall stood a chest of
drawers, brass-bound, massive. She tried the handles, but every
lock was fast. Under the window stood an old sea-chest. It was
a very big sea-chest. One would judge, from its rich carvings and
its ornamental ironwork, that it was probably the sea-chest of an
admiral at least&mdash;perhaps that of Admiral Hernando Mureno,
Armorel's ancestor, if such was his rank in the navy of his Catholic
Majesty. The sight of this sea-chest caused the girl to shiver
with the fear of expectation. Nobody contemplates the absolutely
unknown without a certain fear. It contained, she was certain, the
things that Dorcas had seen, of which she would not speak. The
chest seemed to drag her: it cried, 'Open me. Look inside me&mdash;see
what I have got to show you.'</p>

<p>Then she remembered, as one in a dream, hearing people talk.
Words long forgotten came back to her. 'Twas in Hugh Town,
whither she went across to school when she was as yet a little girl.
'What have the Roseveans'&mdash;thus and thus said the voice&mdash;'done
with all their money? They've never spent anything: they've
gone on saving and saving. Some day we shall find out what
became of it.' Was she going to find out what had become of it?</p>

<p>The old lady, in her most lucid moments, had never dropped
the least hint of any inheritance, except that disagreeable necessity
of getting drowned on account of the unfortunate Robert Fletcher.
And that was not an inheritance to gladden the heart. Yet there
was an inheritance. It was here, in this room. And she was
locked in alone, in order that she, herself unseen by any, might
discover what it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Baron Bluebeard's last wife&mdash;she who afterwards, as a beautiful,
rich, and lively young widow, set so many hearts aflame&mdash;was not
more curious than Armorel. Nor was she, in the course of her
investigations, more afraid than Armorel. The girl looked nervously
about the room, so ghostly and so full of shadow. All old
rooms have their ghosts, but some of them have so many that one
is not afraid of them. There is a sense of companionship in a
crowd of ghosts. This room had only one&mdash;that of the woman
who had grown old in it&mdash;who had spent nearly eighty years in it.
All the old ghosts had grown tired of this monotonous room, gone
away and left the place to her. Armorel not only 'believed in
ghosts'&mdash;many of us accord to these shadows a shadowy, theoretical
belief&mdash;she actually knew that ghosts do sometimes appear. Dorcas
had seen many&mdash;Chessun herself, while not going actually that
length, threw out hints. She herself had often, too, gone to look
for them. Now she glanced nervously where the 'things' were
hanging, expecting to see the ancestral figure reappear, shoulders
move, the bonnet and cap turn round, the old, old face within
them, ready to warn, to admonish, and to guide. If this had happened,
it would have seemed to Armorel nothing but what was
natural and in the regular course of things looked for. But, outside,
the sun shone on the white apple-blossom. No one is very
much afraid of ghosts in the sunshine.</p>

<p>She encouraged herself with this reflection, and began with
unlocking the chest of drawers. The lower drawers, when they
were opened, contained nothing but the 'things' of her great-great-grandmother.
Among them was a box roughly made&mdash;a
boy's box made with a jack-knife: it contained a gold watch with
a French name upon it&mdash;a very old watch, with a representation of
the Annunciation in low relief on the gold face. There were also
in the box two or three gold chains and sundry rings and trinkets.
Armorel took them out and laid them on the table. They were,
she said to herself, part of her inheritance. Was this the Great
Surprise spoken of by Dorcas? She tried the two upper drawers.
They were locked, but she easily found the right key, and opened
them. She found that they were filled with lace; they were
crammed with lace. There were packets of lace tied up tight,
rolls of lace, cardboards with lace wound round and round&mdash;an
immense quantity of lace was lying in these drawers. As for its
value, Armorel knew nothing. Nor did she even ask herself what
the value might be. She only unrolled one or two packets, and
wondered vaguely what in the world she should do with so much
lace. And she wished it was not so yellow. Yet the packets she
unrolled contained Valenciennes&mdash;some of it half a yard wide,
precious almost beyond price. Armorel knew, however, very well
how it had got there, and what it meant. The descendant of so
many brave runners was not ignorant that lace, velvet, silk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
satin, brandy and claret, all came from the French coast with
which her gallant forefathers were so familiar before the Preventive
Service interfered. This, then, was left from the smuggling times.
They had not sold all. They had kept enough, in fact, to
stock half a dozen West-End shops, to adorn the trousseau
of fifty Princesses. And here the stuff had lain undisturbed
since&mdash;well, perhaps, since the unfortunate visit of Mr. Robert
Fletcher.</p>

<p>'My inheritance, so far,' said Armorel, 'is a pile of yellow lace
and a gold watch and chain and some trinkets. Is this the Great
Surprise?' But she looked at the sea-chest. Something more
must be there.</p>

<p>Next she turned to the cupboard. It was locked and double-locked.
But she found the key. The cupboard was one of those
great receptacles common in the oldest houses, almost rooms in
themselves, but dark rooms, where mediæval housekeepers kept
their stores. In those days, housekeeping on a respectable scale
meant the continual maintenance of immense stores. All the
things which now we get from shops as we want them were then
laid in store long before they were wanted. Outside the country
town there were no shops; and, even in London itself, people did
not run to the shop every day. The men had great quantities of
shirts&mdash;three clean shirts a day was the allowance of a solid city
man under good Queen Anne&mdash;a city man who respected himself:
the women had a corresponding quantity of flowered petticoats.
Wine was by no means the only thing laid down for future years.
All these accumulations helped to give solidity to the appearance
of life. When a woman thought of her cupboards filled with fine
linen and a man of his cellars filled with wine, the uncertainty and
brevity of life alleged by the Preacher seemed not to concern them.
It would be absurd to lay down a great bin of good port if one was
not going to live long enough to drink it. The fashion, therefore,
has its advantages.</p>

<p>Armorel threw open the door and looked in. The place was so
dark that she was obliged to light a candle in order to examine the
shelves running round the sides of the cupboard. There was a
strange smell in the place, which, perhaps, had not been opened
for a long time. Bales of some kind lay upon the upper shelves.
Armorel took down two and opened them. They contained silk&mdash;strong,
rich silk. She rolled them up and put them back. On a
lower shelf was a most singular collection. In the front row were
one&mdash;two&mdash;no fewer than six punch-bowls, all of silver except one,
and that was of silver gilt. This must be the Great Surprise.
Armorel took them all out and placed them on the table. For the
most part they showed signs of having been used with freedom&mdash;one
has heard of an empty punch-bowl being kicked about the
place as a conclusion to the feast. But six punch-bowls! 'They
came,' said Armorel, 'from the wrecks.' Behind the punch-bowls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
were silver candlesticks, silver snuffers, silver cups, silver tankards&mdash;some
with coats-of-arms, some with names engraven. There was
also a great silver ship, one of those galleons in silver which
formerly adorned Royal banquets. All these Armorel took out
and arranged upon the table. Among them was a tall hour-glass
mounted in silver. Armorel set the sand running again, after
many years. On the floor there were packets and bundles tied up
and rolled together. Armorel opened one of them, and, finding
that it contained a packet of gold lace and a pair of gold epaulettes,
she left them undisturbed. And standing against the wall, stacked
behind the bundles of gold lace, were swords&mdash;dozens of swords.
What could she do with swords? Well, then, now, at last, she had
found the Great Surprise. But still the sea-chest seemed to drag
her and to call to her: 'Open me! Open me! See what I have
got for you!'</p>

<p>'So far, then,' she said, 'I have inherited a pile of lace; a
gold watch, rings, and chains; six punch-bowls, twenty-four silver
candlesticks, twelve silver cups, four great tankards, a silver ship,
I know not how many old swords, and a bundle of gold lace. I
wonder if these things make a person rich?'</p>

<p>If so, great wealth does not satisfy the soul. This was certain,
because Armorel really felt no richer than before. Yet the array
of punch-bowls was truly imposing, and the silver candlesticks, the
snuffers, the tankards, the cups, and the ship, though they sadly
wanted the brush and the chamois leather, with a pinch of
'whitenin',' were worthy of a College Plate-Room. One might
surely feel a little elation at the thought of owning all this silver,
even if one did not understand its intrinsic value. But, like the
effect of champagne, such elation would quickly wear off.</p>

<p>Next, Armorel remembered the secret cupboard at the head of
the bed. Her own bed had its secret recess at the head&mdash;every
respectable bedstead used formerly to have them. Where else
could money be hidden away safely? To be sure, everybody knew
this hiding-place, but everybody pretended not to know. It was
an open secret, like the concealed drawer in a schoolboy's desk.
Our forefathers were full of such secrets that everybody knew.
The stocking in the teapot: the receptacle under the hearthstone:
the hidden compartment in the cabinet: the secret room: the secret
staircase: the recess in the head of the bed&mdash;these were all secrets
that everybody knew and everybody respected. I think that even
the burglar respected these conventions. Armorel knew how to
open the panel&mdash;she found the spring and it flew open, rustily, as
if it had not been opened for a great many years. Behind the panel
was a recess eighteen inches long and about nine inches deep. And
here stood a Black Jack&mdash;nothing less than a Black Jack; a quart
Jack, not a Leather Jack, but a tankard made of tin and painted
with hunting scenes something like an Etruscan vase, or perhaps
more like a Brown George. Why should anyone want to hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
away a Black Jack? This quart pot, however, held something
better than stingo&mdash;even stronger: it was half-filled with foreign
money. Here were moidores, doubloons, ducats, pieces-of-eight,
Louis d'ors, Spanish pillar dollars, sequins, gold coins from India&mdash;nothing
at all in the pot less than a hundred years old. Armorel
took out a handful and looked at them. Well, gold coins do look
like money. She began to feel really rich. She had a quart tankard
half-full of gold coins. She added the Black Jack to the other
treasures on the table. All this foreign money must have come
out of the wrecks. And, since it was all so old, out of wrecks that
had happened before the memory even of the Ancient Lady. This,
then, was perhaps the Great Surprise.</p>

<p>But there remained the sea-chest under the window, and again,
when Armorel looked upon it, the chest continued to call to her,
'Open me! Open me! See what I have for you!'</p>

<p>Armorel found the key which unlocked it, and threw open the
lid. Within, there was the deep tray which belongs to every sea-chest.
This was filled with a quantity of uninteresting brown
canvas bags. She wanted to see what was below, and tried to lift
the tray, but it was too heavy. Then, still regarding the bags as
of no account, she took one out. It was heavy, and when she
lifted it there was a clink as of coin. It was tied tightly at the
mouth with a piece of string. She opened it. Within there were
gold coins. She took out a handful: they were all sovereigns,
some of them worn, some quite new and fresh from the Mint. She
poured out the whole contents of the bag on the table. Why, it
was actually full of golden sovereigns. Nothing else in the bag. All
golden sovereigns! And there were five hundred of them. She
counted them. Five hundred pounds! She had never, it is true,
thought much about money&mdash;but&mdash;five hundred pounds! It seemed
an amazing sum. Five hundred pounds! And all in a single bag.
And such a little bag as this. She put back the money and tied
up the bag.</p>

<p>Then she took out another bag. This was as big as the first,
and heavier. It was full of guineas&mdash;Armorel counted them.
There were also five hundred of them. Some of them were so old
that they bore the impression of the elephant, and therefore
belonged to the seventeenth century. But most of them belonged
to the eighteenth century, and bore the heads of the three first
Georges. Five hundred guineas&mdash;and never before had Armorel
seen a guinea! Well, she thought, that made a thousand pounds.
She took up another bag and opened it. That, too, weighed as much
and was full of gold. And another, and yet another. They were
all full of gold. And now she knew what Dorcas meant&mdash;this&mdash;nothing
but this&mdash;was the Great Surprise! Not the punch-bowls,
or the lace, or the bales of silk, but these bags full of gold constituted
her wealth. She understood money, you see: lace and silk were
beyond her. This was her inheritance!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Consider: the Roseveans, from father to son, had been from time
immemorial wreckers, smugglers, and pilots. They were also
farmers. On their little farm they grew nearly enough to support
their simple lives. They had pigs and poultry; they had milch
cows; they had a few sheep; they kept geese, pigeons, ducks;
they made their own beer and their own cordials and strong waters;
they made their own linen; they were unto themselves millers,
tinkers, carpenters, cabinet-makers, builders, and thatchers. They
grew their own salads and vegetables, and if they wanted any
fruit they grew that as well. Oats and barley they grew, clover
and hay. I believe that on Samson wheat has never been grown&mdash;indeed,
there are only eighty acres in all. There was left, therefore,
little to buy. Coals, wood for fuel and for carpentering,
things in iron, crockery, tools, cloth clothes, flannel, flour, and
sometimes a little beef&mdash;what else did they want? As for fish, they
had only to catch as much as they wanted. Tea, coffee, sugar, and
so forth came in with later civilisation, when small ale, possets,
and hypsy died out.</p>

<p>In order to provide these small deficiencies they were pilots, to
begin with. This trade brought in a steady income. They also
sent out boats, filled with fresh vegetables, to meet the homeward-bound
East Indiamen. And they were also, like the rest of the
artless islanders, wreckers and smugglers. In the former capacity
they occasionally acquired an extraordinary quantity of odd and
valuable things. In the latter profession they made at times, and
until the Peace and the Preventive Service put an end to the
business, a really fine income.</p>

<p>Then, on Samson, they continued to live after the patriarchal
fashion and in the old simplicity. Each Captain Rosevean in turn
was the chieftain or sheik. To him his family brought all that
they earned or found. The sea-chest took it all. For three hundred
years, at least, this sea-chest received everything and gave up
nothing. Nobody ever took anything out of it: nobody looked into
it: nobody knew, until Ursula counted the money and made bags
for it, what there was in the chest. Nobody ever asked if they were
rich or how rich they were.</p>

<p>There was no bank on Samson: there is not even now a bank
in the Scilly archipelago at all: nobody understood any other way
of saving money than the good old fashion of putting it by in a
bag. On Samson there never were thieves, even when as many as
fifty people lived on the island. Therefore the Captain Rosevean
of the time, though he knew not how much was saved, nor did he
ever inquire, laid the last additions to the pile in the tray of the
old sea-chest with the rest, and, having locked it up, dropped the
key in his pocket, and went about his business in perfect confidence,
never thinking either that it might be stolen, or that he
might count up his hoard, proceed to enjoy it, and alter his simple
way of life. Every Captain Rosevean in succession added to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hoard every year; not one among them all thought of spending
it or taking anything from it. He added to it. Nobody ever
counted it until the reign of Ursula. It was she who made the
little brown bags of canvas: she, usurping the place of Family
Chief or Sheik, took from her sons and grandsons all the money
that they made. They gave it over to her keeping&mdash;she was the
Family Bank. And, like her predecessors in that room, she told
no one of the hoard.</p>

<p>Most of the bags contained guineas of George I., George II.,
and George III., down to the year 1816, when the Mint left off
coining guineas. A few contained sovereigns of later date; but
the family savings since that year had been small and uncertain.
The really fat time&mdash;the prosperous time&mdash;when the money
poured in, was during the long war which lasted for nearly five-and-twenty
years.</p>

<p>There were actually forty of these bags. Armorel laid them
out upon the table and counted them. Forty! And each bag to
all appearance, for she only counted two, contained five hundred
guineas or pounds. Forty times five hundred&mdash;that makes twenty
thousand pounds, if all were sovereigns! There are, I am told,
a few young ladies in this country who have as much as twenty
thousand pounds for their dot. There are also a great many
young ladies in France, and an amazing multitude, whom no
man may number, in the United States of America, who have as
much. But I am quite sure that not one of these heiresses, except
Armorel herself, has ever actually gazed upon her fortune
in a concrete form&mdash;tangible&mdash;to be counted&mdash;to be weighed&mdash;to
be admired. It is a pity that they cannot do this, if only because
they would then see for themselves what a very small pile of gold
a fortune of twenty thousand pounds actually makes. This would
make them humble. Armorel stood looking at the table thus
laden with bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>'I have got,' she murmured, 'twenty thousand sovereigns
and guineas at least: I have got a painted pot full of old money.
I have got six punch-bowls, a great silver ship, a large number
of silver candlesticks and cups: I have got a silver-mounted
hour-glass'&mdash;its sand was now nearly run&mdash;'I have got a great
quantity of lace and silk. I suppose all this does make riches.
Whatever shall I do with it? Shall I give it to the poor? or
shall I put it back into the box and leave it there? But perhaps
there is something else in the box.'</p>

<p>The chest, in fact, continued to call aloud to be examined.
Even while Armorel looked at her glittering treasures spread out
upon the table she felt herself drawn towards the chest. There
was more in it. There was another Surprise waiting for her&mdash;even
a greater Surprise, perhaps, than that of the bags of gold. 'Search
me!' cried the chest. 'Search me! Look into the innermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
recesses of me: explore my contents to the very bottom: let
nothing escape your eyes.'</p>

<p>Armorel knelt down before the chest and took out the tray.
It was empty now, and she could lift it easily.</p>

<p>Beneath the tray there was a most miscellaneous collection of
things.</p>

<p>They lay in layers, separated and divided&mdash;Ursula's hand was
here&mdash;by silk handkerchiefs of the good old kind&mdash;the bandanna,
now gone out of fashion.</p>

<p>First Armorel took out and laid on the floor a layer of silver
spoons, silver ladles, even silver dishes, all of antique appearance
and for the most part stamped with a crest or a coat-of-arms: for
in the old days if a man was Armiger he loved to place his shield
on everything; to look at it and glory in it: to let others see it
and envy it.</p>

<p>Then she found a layer of watches. There were gold watches
and silver watches; the latter of all kinds, down to the veritable
turnip. The glasses were broken of nearly all, and, if one had
examined, the works would have been found rusted with the sea-water
which had got in. What were they worth now? Perhaps
the value of the cases and of the jewels with which the works were
set, and more with one or two, where miniatures adorned the back
and jewels were set in the face. Armorel turned with impatience
from the watches to the gold chains, which lay beside them.
There were yards of gold chain: gold chains of all kinds, from
the heavy English make to the dainty interlaced Venetian and
thread-like Trichinopoly; there were silver chains also&mdash;massive
silver chains, made for some extinct office-bearer, perhaps bo's'n
on the Admiral's ship of the Great Armada. Armorel drew up
some of the chains and played with them, tying them round her
wrists and letting them slip through her fingers&mdash;the pretty delicate
things, which spoke of wealth almost as loudly as the bags of
guineas.</p>

<p>She laid them aside, and took up a silk handkerchief containing
a small collection of miniatures. They were almost all portraits
of women: young and pretty women: ladies on land whose faces
warmed the hearts and fired the memories of men at sea. The
miniatures had hung round the necks of some and had lain in the
sea-chests of others, whose bones had long since melted to nothing
in the salt sea depths, while those of their mistresses had turned
to dust beneath the aisle of some village church, their memory
long since forgotten, and their very name trampled out by the feet
of the rustics.</p>

<p>Armorel laid aside these pictures&mdash;they were very pretty, but
she would look at them again another time.</p>

<p>The next parcel was a much larger one. It consisted of snuff-boxes.
There were dozens of snuff-boxes: one or two of gold: one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
or two silver-gilt: some silver. In the lids of some were pictures,
some most beautifully and delicately executed; some of
subjects which Armorel did not understand&mdash;and why, she thought,
should painters draw people without proper clothes? Venus and
the Graces and the Nymphs, in whom our eighteenth-century
ancestors took such huge delight, were to this young person merely
people. The snuff-boxes were very well in their way, but Armorel
had no inclination to look at them again.</p>

<p>Then she found in a handkerchief, the four corners of which
were loosely tied together, a great quantity of rings. There were
rings of every kind&mdash;the official ring or the ring of office, the signet-ring,
the ring with the shield, the ring with the name of a ship,
the ring with the name of a regiment, mourning-rings, wedding-rings,
betrothal-rings, rings with posies, cramp-rings with the names
of the Magi on them&mdash;but their power was gone&mdash;gimmal-rings,
rings episcopal, rings barbaric, mediæval, and modern, rings set
with every kind of precious stone&mdash;there were hundreds of rings.
All drowned sailors used to have rings on their fingers.</p>

<p>Armorel began to get tired of all these treasures. Beneath
them, however, at the bottom of the box, lay piled together a mass
of curios. They were stowed away for the most part in small
boxes, of foreign make and appearance: ivory boxes: carved wood
boxes. They consisted of all kinds of things, such as gold and
silver buckles, brooches, painted fans, jewel-hilted daggers, crystal
tubes of attar of roses, and knives of curious construction. The
girl sighed: she would look over them at another time. They
would, perhaps, add something to the inheritance, but for the
moment she was satisfied. She had seen enough. She was putting
back a dagger whose jewelled handle flashed in the unaccustomed
light, when she saw, lying half hidden among this pile of curious
things, the corner of a chagreen case. This attracted her curiosity,
and she took it out. The chagreen had been green in colour, but
was now very much discoloured. It had been fastened by a silver
clasp, but this was broken: a small leather strap was attached to
two corners. Armorel expected to find another bag of money.
But this did not contain gold. It was lighter than the canvas bags.
As she took it into her hands she remembered the bag of Robert
Fletcher. Yes. The leathern strap of this case had been cut
through. She held in her hands&mdash;she was certain&mdash;the abominable
Thing that had brought so much trouble on the family. Again the
room felt ghostly: she heard voices whispering: the voices of all
those who had been drowned: the voices of the women who had
mourned for them: the voice of the old lady who was herself a
witness of the crime. They all whispered together in her ears:
'Armorel, you must find him. You must give it back to him.'</p>

<p>What was in it? The clasp acted no longer. Armorel lifted
the overlapping leather and looked within. There was a thick roll
of silk. She took this out. Wrapped up in the silk, laid in folds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
side by side, were a quantity of stones&mdash;common-looking stones,
such as one may pick up, she thought, on the beach of Porth Bay.
There were a couple of hundred or more, mostly small stones, only
one or two of them bigger than the top of Armorel's little finger.</p>

<p>'Only stones!' she cried. 'All this trouble about a bag full
of red stones!'</p>

<p>Among the stones lay a small folded paper. Armorel opened
it. The paper was discoloured by age or by water, and most of
the writing was effaced. But she could read some of it.</p>

<p>'... from the King of Burmah himself. This ruby I estimate
to be worth ... 000<i>l.</i> at the very least. The other ... Mines.
The second largest stone weighs ... about 2,000<i>l.</i> The smaller
... rt Fletcher.'</p>

<p>It was a note on the contents of the parcel, written by the
owner.</p>

<p>The stones, therefore, were rubies, uncut rubies. Armorel
knew little about precious stones and jewels, but she had heard
and read of them. The price of a virtuous woman, she knew, was
far above rubies. And Solomon's fairest among women was made
comely with rows of jewels. Queen Sheba, moreover, brought
precious stones among her presents to the Wise King. The girl
wondered why such common-looking objects as these should be
precious. But she was humbly ignorant, and put that wonder by.</p>

<p>This, then, was nothing less than Robert Fletcher's fortune.
He had this round his neck, and he was bringing it home to enjoy.
And it was taken from him by her ancestor. A wicked thing
indeed! A foul and wicked thing! And the poor man had been
sent empty away to begin his life all over again. She shivered as
she looked at them. All for the sake of these dull, red bits of
stone! How can man so easily fall into temptation? In the
empty room, so quiet, so ghostly, she heard again the whispers,
'Armorel, find him&mdash;find the man&mdash;and give him back his jewels.'</p>

<p>She replied aloud, not daring to look round her lest she should
see the pale and eager faces of those who had suffered death by
drowning in consequence of this sin, 'Yes&mdash;yes, I will find him!
I will find him!'</p>

<p>She pushed the chagreen case back into its corner and covered
it up. 'I will find him,' she repeated. Then she rose to her feet
and looked about the room. Heavens! What a sight! The bags
of gold, two of them open, their contents lying piled upon the
table&mdash;the chains of gold on the floor&mdash;the handful of old gold
coins lying on the table beside the Black Jack, the snuff-boxes,
the miniatures, the punch-bowls, the rings, the silver cups&mdash;the
low room, dark and quiet, filled with ghosts and voices, the recent
occupant wagging her shoulders and shaking the back of her bonnet
at her from the opposite wall, and, through the open window, the
sight of the sunlight on the apple-blossoms mocking the gold and
silver in this gloomy cave. She comprehended, as yet, little of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
extent of her good fortune. Lace and silk, rings and miniatures,
snuff-boxes: all these things had no value to her&mdash;of buying and
selling she had no kind of experience. All she understood was
that she was the possessor of a vast quantity of things for which
she could find no possible use&mdash;one jewelled dagger, for instance,
might be used for a dinner-knife, or for a paper-knife; but what
could she do with a dozen? In addition to this museum of pretty
and useless things she had forty bags with five hundred guineas,
or pounds, in each&mdash;twenty-one thousand pounds, say, in cash.
This museum was perfectly unique: no family in Great Britain
had such a collection. It had been growing for more than three
hundred years: it was begun in the time of the Tudor Kings, at
least, perhaps even earlier. Wrecks there were, and Roseveans,
on Samson, before the seventh Henry. I doubt if any other family,
even the oldest and the noblest, has been collecting so long. Certainly
no other family, even in this archipelago of wrecks, can have
had such opportunities of collecting with such difficulties in dissipating.
For more than three hundred years! And Armorel was
sole heiress!</p>

<p>She understood that she had inherited something more than
twenty thousand pounds&mdash;how much more, she knew not. Now,
unless one knows something of the capacities of one single pound,
one cannot arrive at the possibilities of twenty thousand pounds.
Armorel knew as much as this. Tea at Hugh Town costs two
shillings a pound&mdash;perhaps two-and-four&mdash;sugar threepence a
pound: nun's cloth so much a yard&mdash;serge and flannel so much:
coals, so much a ton: wood for fuel, so much. This was nearly the
extent of her knowledge: and it must be confessed that it goes very
little way towards a right comprehension of twenty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Once, again, she had heard Justinian talking of the flower-farm.
'It has made,' he said, 'four hundred pounds this year, clear.'
To which Dorcas replied, 'And the housekeeping doesn't come to
half that, nor near it.' Whence, by the new light of this Great
Surprise, she concluded, first, that the other two hundred, thus
made, must have been added to those money-bags, and, next, that
two hundred pounds a year would be a liberal allowance for her
whole yearly expenditure. Then she made a little calculation.
Two hundred pounds a year&mdash;two hundred into twenty thousand&mdash;twenty
thousand&mdash;two and four noughts&mdash;she put five bags in a row
for the number&mdash;subtract two&mdash;she did so&mdash;there remained three&mdash;divide
by two&mdash;she did so&mdash;one hundred years was the result of
that sum. Her twenty thousand pounds would therefore last her
exactly one hundred years. At the expiration of the century all
would be gone. For the first time in her life Armorel comprehended
the fleeting nature of riches. And, naturally, the discovery,
though she shivered at the thought of losing all, made her
feel a little proud. A strange result of wealth, to advance the
inheritor one more step in the knowledge of possible misery! She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was like unto the curious youth who opens a book of medicine,
only to learn of new diseases and terrible sufferings and alarming
symptoms, and to imagine these in his own body of corruption.
In a hundred years there would be no more. She would then be
reduced to sell the lace and the other things for what they would
then be worth. There would still, however, remain the flower-farm.
She would, after all, be no worse off than before the Great
Surprise. And then there sprang up in her heart the blossom of
another thought, to be developed, later on, into a lovely flower.</p>

<p>She had risen from her knees now, and was standing beside the
table, vaguely gazing upon her inheritance. It was all before her.
So the Ancient Lady had stood many and many a time counting the
money: looking to see if all was safe: content to count it and to
know that it was there. The old lady was gone, but from the opposite
wall her shoulders and the back of her bonnet were looking on.</p>

<p>Well: Armorel might go on doing exactly the same. She might
live as her forefathers had lived: there was the flower-farm to provide
all their necessities: if it brought in four hundred pounds a
year, she could add two hundred to the heap&mdash;in every two years
and a half another bag of five hundred sovereigns. All her people
had done this&mdash;why not she? It seemed expected of her; a plain
duty laid upon her shoulders. If she were to live on for eighty
years longer&mdash;which would bring her to her great-great-grandmother's
age&mdash;she would save eighty times two hundred&mdash;sixteen
thousand pounds. The inheritance would then be worth thirty-six
thousand pounds&mdash;a prodigious sum of money indeed. And,
besides, the Black Jack, with its foreign gold, and the rings and
lace and things!</p>

<p>A strange room it was this morning. What voice was it that
whispered solemnly in her ear, 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures
upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
break through and steal'?</p>

<p>Never before had this injunction possessed any other significance
to her than belongs to one manifestly addressed to other
people. The Bible is full of warnings addressed to other people.
Armorel was like the Royal Duke who used to murmur during the
weekly utterance of the Commandments, 'Never did that. Never
did that.' Now, this precept was clearly and from the very first
intended to meet her own case. Oh! To live for nothing than to
add more bags to that tray in the great sea-chest!</p>

<p>Roland had prophesied that there would be a change. It had
come already in part, and more was coming.</p>

<p>What next? As yet the girl did not understand that she was
mistress of her own fate. Hitherto things had been done for her.
She was now about to act for herself. But how? If Roland were
only here! But he had only written once, and he had never kept
his promise to write back again to Samson. If he were here he
could advise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked around, and saw the heaps of things that were all
hers, and she laughed. The girl whom Roland thought to be only
an ignorant and poor little country girl, a flower-farmer's girl of
Samson Island, living alone with her old grandmother and the
serving-folk, was ignorant still, no doubt. But she was not poor:
she was rich&mdash;she could have all that can be bought with money&mdash;she
was rich. What would Roland say and think? And she
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>She was rich&mdash;the last girl in the world to hope, or expect, or
desire riches. Thus Fate mocks us, giving to one, who wants it
not, wealth: and to another, who knows not how to use it, youth:
and to a third, insensible of its power, beauty. The young lady of
society, she whom the good old hymns used to call the Worldling&mdash;fond
and pretty title! there are no Worldlings now&mdash;would have
had no difficulty in knowing how to use this wonderful windfall.
She, indeed, is always longing, perhaps praying, for money: she is
always thinking how delightful it would be to be rich, and how there
is nothing in the whole world more desirable than much fine gold.
But to Lady Worldling, poor thing! such a windfall never happens.
Again, there are all the distressed gentlewomen, the unappreciated
artists, the authors whose books won't sell, the lawyers who have
no clients, the wives whose name is Quiverful, the tradesman who
'scapes the Bankruptcy Court year after year by the skin of his
teeth, and the poor dear young man who pines away because he
cannot join the rabble rout of Comus&mdash;why, why does not such a
windfall ever come to any of these? It never does: yet they spend
all their spare time&mdash;all the time when they ought to be planning
and devising ways and means of advancement&mdash;in dreaming of the
golden days they would enjoy, if only such a windfall fell to them.
One such man I knew: he dreamed of wealth all his life: he tried
to become rich by taking every year a share in a foreign lottery.
Of course, he never won a prize. While he was yet young and
even far down the shady or outer slope of middle age he continually
built castles in the air, fashioning pleasant ways for himself when
he should get that prize. When he grew old, he dreamed of the
will he would make and of the envy with which other old men, when
he was gone, should regard the memory of one who had cut up so
well. So he died poor; but I think he had always, through his
dreaming, been as happy as if he had been rich.</p>

<p>Armorel told herself, standing in the midst of this great treasure,
that she was rich. Roland had once told her, she remembered,
that an artist ought to have money in order to be free: only in
freedom, he said, could a man make the best of himself. What
was good for an artist might be good for her. At the same time&mdash;it
is not for nothing that a girl reads and ponders over the Gospels&mdash;there
were terrible words of warning&mdash;there were instances. She
shuddered, overwhelmed with the prospects of new dangers.</p>

<p>She knew everything: the room had yielded all its secrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
there were no more cupboards, boxes, or drawers. The sight of
the treasures already began to pall upon her. She applied herself
to putting everything back. First the chagreen case. This she
laid carefully in its corner among the daggers and pistols, remembering
that she had promised to find the owner. How should she
do that if she remained on Samson? Then she put back the snuff-boxes,
the miniatures, and the watches in their silk handkerchiefs:
then the box of rings and the silver spoons and dishes. Then she
put the tray in its place and laid the bags in the tray, and locked
the old sea-chest. This done, she bore back to the shelves in the
cupboard the punch-bowls, candlesticks, tankards, and the big silver
ship: she locked and double-locked the cupboard-door: she crammed
the lace into the drawers, and put back the box of trinkets.</p>

<p>Then she dropped the keys in her pocket. Oh! what a lump
to carry about all day long! But the weight of the keys in her
pocket was nothing to the weight that was laid upon her shoulders
by her great possessions. This, however, she hardly felt at first.</p>

<p>Everything was her own.</p>

<p>When the new King comes to the throne he makes a great
clearance of all the personal belongings of the old King. He gives
away his cloaks and his uniforms, and all the things belonging to
the daily life of his predecessor. That is always done. Therefore,
Queen Armorel&mdash;Vivat Regina!&mdash;at this point gathered together
all her predecessor's belongings. She turned them out of the
drawers and laid them on the floor&mdash;with the great bonnet and
the wonderful cap of ribbons. And then she opened the door. She
would give these things to Dorcas. Her great-great-grandmother
should have no more authority there. Even her clothes must go.
If her ghost should remain, it should be without the bonnet and
the cap.</p>

<p>She called Dorcas, who came, curious to know how her young
mistress took the Great Surprise. Armorel had taken it, apparently,
as a matter of course. So the new King stands upon the highest
step of the Throne, calm and collected, as if he had been prepared
for this event, and was expecting it day after day.</p>

<p>'You know all now, dearie?' she whispered, shutting the door
carefully. 'Did you find everything?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;I believe I found everything.'</p>

<p>'The silver in the cupboard: the lace: the bags of gold?'</p>

<p>'I think I have found everything, Dorcas.'</p>

<p>'Then you are rich, my dear. No Rosevean before you was
ever half so rich. For none of it has been spent. They've all
gone on saving and adding&mdash;almost to the last she saved and added.
Oh! the last thing she lost was the love of saving, and the jealousy
of her keys she never lost. Oh! you are very rich&mdash;you are the
richest girl in the whole of Scilly&mdash;not even in St. Mary's is there
anyone who can compare with you. Even the Lord Proprietor
himself&mdash;I hardly know.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes. I believe I must be very rich,' said Armorel. 'Dorcas,
you kept her secret. Keep mine as well. Let no one know.'</p>

<p>'No one shall know, dearie&mdash;no one. But lock the door. Keep
the door locked always.'</p>

<p>'I will. Now, Dorcas, here are all her dresses and things. You
must take them all away and keep them. They are for you.'</p>

<p>'Very well, dearie. Though how I'm to wear black silk&mdash;&mdash; Oh!
Child,' she cried, out of the religious terrors of her soul&mdash;'it
is written that it is harder for a rich man to enter into heaven
than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. My dear,
if these great riches are to drag your soul down into hell, it would
be better if they were all thrown into the sea, the silver punch-bowls
and the bags of gold and all. But there's one comfort. It
doesn't say, impossible. It only says, harder. So that now and
then, perhaps, a rich man may wriggle in&mdash;just one&mdash;and oh! I
wish, seeing the number of rich people there are in the world,
that there'd been shown one camel&mdash;only a single camel&mdash;going
through the needle's eye. Think what a miracle! 'Twould have
brought conviction to all who saw it, and consolation ever afterwards
to all who considered it&mdash;oh! the many thousands of afflicted
souls who are born rich! You are not the only one, child, who is
rich through no fault of her own. Often have I told Justinian,
thinking of her, and he not knowing or suspecting, but believing I
was talking silly, that, considering the warnings and woes pronounced
against the rich, we cannot be too thankful. But don't
despair, my dear&mdash;it is nowhere said to be impossible. And there's
the rich young man, to be sure, who was told to sell all that he
had and to give to the poor. He went away sorrowful. You can't
do that, Armorel, because there are no poor on Samson. And it's
said, "Woe unto you that are rich, for you have had your consolation!"
Well, but if your money never is your consolation&mdash;and
I'm sure I don't know what it is going to console you for&mdash;that
doesn't apply to you, does it? There's the story of the Rich Man,
again; and there's texts upon texts, when you come to think of
them. You will remember them, child, and they will be your
warnings. Besides, you are not going to waste and riot like a
Prodigal Son, and where your earthly treasure is there you will
not set your heart. You will go on like all the Roseveans before
you: and though the treasure is kept locked up, you will add to it
every year out of your savings, just as they did.'</p>

<p>'There is another parable, Dorcas. I think I ought to remember
that as well. It is that of the Talents. If the man who was
rich with Five Talents had locked them up, he would not have
been called a good and faithful servant.'</p>

<p>'Yes, dearie, yes. You will find some Scripture to comfort and
assure your soul, no doubt. There's a good deal in Scripture.
Something for all sorts, as they say. Though, after all, riches is a
dangerous thing. Child! if they knew it over at St. Mary's, not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
young man in the place but would be sailing over to Samson to try
his luck. Our secret, child, all to ourselves.'</p>

<p>'Yes; our secret, Dorcas. And now take away all these things,
everything that belonged to her: there are her shoes&mdash;take them
too. I want the room to be all my own. So.'</p>

<p>When all the things were gone, Armorel closed and locked the
door. Then she ran out of the house gasping, for she choked.
Everything was turned into gold. She gasped and choked and ran
out over the hill and down the steps and across the narrow plain,
and up the northern hill, hoping to drive some of the ghosts from
her brain, and to shake off some of the bewildering caused by the
Great Surprise. But a good deal remained, and especially the
religious terrors suggested by that pious Bryanite Christian and
Divider of the Word, Dorcas Tryeth.</p>

<p>When she sat down in the old place upon the carn, the great
gulf between herself and Bryher island reminded her of that
great gulf in the parable. How if she should be the Rich Man
sitting for ever and for ever on the red-hot rock, tormented with
pain and thirst&mdash;and how if on Samson Hill beyond she should
see Abraham himself, the patriarch, with Lazarus lying at his feet&mdash;as
yet she had developed no Lazarus&mdash;but who knows the future?
The Rich Man must have been a thoughtless and selfish person.
Until now the parable never interested her at all: why should it?
She had no money.</p>

<p>The other passages, those which Dorcas had kindly quoted in
this her first hour of wealth, came crowding into her mind, and
told her they were come to stay. All these texts she had previously
classed with the denunciations of sins the very meaning of which she
knew not. She had no concern with such wickedness. Nor could
she possibly understand how it was that people, when they actually
knew that they must not do such things, still went on doing
them. Now, however, having become rich herself, all the warnings
of the New Testament seemed directed against herself. Already,
the load of wealth was beginning to weigh upon her young shoulders.</p>

<p>She changed the current of her thoughts. Even the richest
girl cannot be always thinking about woes and warnings. Else she
would do nothing, good or bad. She began to think about the
outer world. She had been thinking of it constantly ever since
Roland left her. Now, as she looked across the broad Roadstead,
and remembered that thirty miles beyond Telegraph Hill rose the
cliffs where the outer world begins&mdash;they can be seen in a clear
day&mdash;a longing, passionate and irresistible, seized her. She could
go away now, whenever she pleased. She could visit the outer
world and make the acquaintance of the people who live in it.</p>

<p>She laughed, thinking how Justinian, who had never been
beyond St. Mary's, pictured, as he was fond of doing, the outer
world. The Sea of Tiberias was to him the Road: the Jordan was
like Grinsey Sound: the steep place down which the swine fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
into the sea was like Shipman's Head: the Sermon on the Mount
took place on just such a spot as the carn of the North Hill on
Samson, with the sun shining on the Western Islands: the New
Jerusalem in his mind was a city like Hugh Town, consisting of one
long street with stone houses, roofed with slate; each house two
storeys high, a door in the middle, and one window on each side.
On the north side of the New Jerusalem was the harbour, with the
ships, the sea-shore, and the open sea beyond: on the south side
was a bay with beaches of white sand and black rocks at the
entrance, exactly like Porth Cressa. And it was a quiet town,
with seldom any noise of wheels, and always the sound of the sea
lapping on either hand, north or south.</p>

<p>Now, there was nothing to keep her: she could go to visit the
outer world whenever she pleased&mdash;if only she knew how. A girl
of sixteen can hardly go forth into the wide, wide world all alone,
announcing to the four corners her desire to make the acquaintance
of everybody and to understand anything.</p>

<p>And then she began to remember her teacher's last instructions.
The perfect girl was one who had trained her eye and her hand:
she could play one instrument well: she understood music:
she understood art: she was always gracious, sympathetic, and
encouraging: she knew how to get their best out of men: she
was always beautifully dressed: she had the sweetest and the most
beautiful manners.</p>

<p>And here she blushed crimson, and then turned pale, and felt a
pang as if a knife had pierced her very heart. For a dreadful
thought struck her. She thought she understood at last the true
reason why Roland never came back, though he promised, and
looked so serious when he promised.</p>

<p>Why? why? Because she was so ill-mannered. Of course
that was the reason. Why did Roland speak so strongly about the
perfect girl's gracious and sympathetic manners, unless to make
her understand, in this kindly and thoughtful way, how much was
wanting in herself? Of course, he only looked upon her as a common
country girl, who knew nothing, and would never learn anything.
He wanted her to understand that&mdash;to feel that she would never
rise to higher levels. He drew this picture of the perfect girl to
make and keep her humble. Nay, but now she had this money&mdash;all
this wealth&mdash;now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash; She sprang to her feet and threw
out her arms, the gesture that she had learned I know not where.
'Oh!' she cried, 'it is the gift of the Five Talents! I am not the
rich young man. I have not received these riches for my consolation.
They are my Five Talents. I will go away and learn&mdash;I
will learn. I will become the perfect girl. I will train eye and
hand. I will grow&mdash;grow&mdash;grow&mdash;to my full height. That will
be true work in the service of the Giver of those Talents. I shall
become a good and faithful servant when I have risen to the stature
that is possible for me!'</p>

friend, and when&mdash;&mdash;' Her voice dropped, and she did not finish
the sentence. It is absurd to finish a sentence which is understood.</p>

<p>'Perhaps she will not do anything very outrageous.'</p>

<p>'Well, my dear, Mr. Jagenal distinctly said that her manner&mdash;&mdash;'
Again she left the sentence unfinished. Perhaps it was her
habit.</p>

<p>'As she bears our name and comes from our place we can
hardly deny the cousinship. In a few minutes, however, we shall
know the worst.'</p>

<p>Philippa, dressed for dinner, was standing before the fire, tapping
the fender impatiently with her foot, and playing with her
fan. A handsome girl of three- or four-and-twenty: handsome,
not pretty, if you please, nor lovely. By no means. Handsome,
with a kind of beauty which no painter or sculptor would assign to
Lady Venus, because it lacked softness; nor to Diana, because
that huntress, chaste and fair, was country-bred, and Philippa was
of the town&mdash;urban. The young lady was perfectly well satisfied
with her own style of beauty. If she exaggerated a little its power,
that is a common feminine mistake. The exaggeration brings to
dress a moral responsibility. Philippa was dressed this evening
in a creamy white silk, which had the effect of softening a face and
manner somewhat cold and even hard. The young men of the
period complained that Philippa was stand-offish. Certainly she
did not commit the mistake, too common among girls, of plunging
straight off into sympathetic interest with every young man.
Philippa waited for the young men to interest her, if they could.
Generally, they could not. And, while many girls listen with
affected deference to the opinions of the young man, Philippa made
the young man receive hers with deference. These plain facts
show, perhaps, why Philippa, at twenty-four, was still free and
unengaged.</p>

<p>In appearance she was tall&mdash;all young ladies who respect themselves
are tall in these days: her features were clearly cut, if a
little pronounced: her hazel eyes were intellectually bright, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
cold: her hair, the least-marked feature, was of a common brown
colour, but she treated it so as to produce a distinctive effect: her
mouth was fine, though her lips were rather thin: her figure was
correct, though Venus herself would have preferred more of it,
and, perhaps, that more flexible. But it is the commonplace girl,
we know, who runs to plumpness.</p>

<p>She was dressed with greater care than usual that evening,
because people were coming, but not to dinner. The only guests
at dinner were to be one Mr. Jagenal, the well known family solicitor,
of Lincoln's Inn, and a certain far-off cousin, named Armorel
Rosevean, from the Scilly Isles, and her companion and chaperon,
one Mrs. Jerome Elstree&mdash;unknown.</p>

<p>'My dear,' her mother began, 'you are too desponding. Mr.
Jagenal assured your father&mdash;&mdash;' She dropped her voice again.</p>

<p>'Oh! He is an old bachelor. What does he know? Our
cousin comes from Scilly. So did we. It does very well to talk
of coming from Scilly, as if it was something grand, but I have been
looking into a book about it. Old families of Scilly, we say. Why,
they have never been anything but farmers and smugglers. And
our cousin, I hear, is actually a small tenant-farmer&mdash;a flower-farmer&mdash;a
kind of market-gardener! She grows daffodils and
jonquils and anemones and snowdrops, and sells them. Very likely
the daffodils on our table have come from her farm. Perhaps she
will tell us about the price they fetch a dozen. And she will inform
us at dinner how she counts the stalks and makes out the
bills.'</p>

<p>'Absurd! She is an heiress. Mr. Jagenal says&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'An heiress? How can she be an heiress?' Philippa repeated,
with scorn. 'She inherits the lease of a little flower-farm. The
people of Scilly are all quite, quite poor. My book says so. Some
years ago the Scilly folk were nearly starving.'</p>

<p>'Your book must be wrong, Philippa. Mr. Jagenal says that
the girl has a respectable fortune. When a man of his experience
says that, he means&mdash;&mdash;' Here her voice dropped again.</p>

<p>'Well; the island heiress will go back, I dare say, to her
inheritance.'</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Jagenal himself was announced&mdash;elderly,
precise, exact in appearance and in language.</p>

<p>'You have not yet seen your cousin?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No. She will be here immediately, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'Your cousin came to our house five years ago. My late partner
received her. She brought a letter from a clergyman then at the
Scilly Islands. She was sixteen, quite ignorant of the world,
and a really interesting girl. She had inherited a very handsome
fortune. My late partner found her tutors and guardians, and she
has been travelling and learning. Now she has come to London
again. She chooses to be her own mistress, and has taken a flat.
And I have found a companion for her&mdash;widow of an artist&mdash;our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
young friend Alec Feilding knew about her&mdash;name of Elstree. I
think she will do very well.'</p>

<p>'Alec knew her? He has never told me of any lady of that
name.' Philippa looked a little astonished.</p>

<p>Then the girl of whom they were talking, with the companion in
question, appeared.</p>

<p>You know how one forms in the mind a whole image, or group
of images, preparatory; and how these shadows are all dispelled
by the appearance of the reality. At the very first sight of Armorel,
Philippa's prejudices and expectations&mdash;the vision of the dowdy
rustic, the half-bred island savage, the uncouth country maiden&mdash;all
vanished into thin air. New prejudices might arise&mdash;it is a
mistake to suppose that because old prejudices have been cleared
away there can be no more&mdash;but, in this case, the old ones
vanished. For while Armorel walked across the room, and while
Mrs. Rosevean stepped forward to welcome her, Philippa made
the discovery that her cousin knew how to carry herself, how to
walk, and how to dress. Girls who have learned these three
essentials have generally learned how to talk as well. And a young
lady of London understands at the first glance whether a strange
young person, her sister in the bonds of humanity, is also a lady.
As for the dress, it showed genius either on the part of Armorel
herself or of her advisers. There was genius in the devising and
invention of it. But genius of this kind one can buy. There
was the genius of audacity in the wearing of it, because it was a
dress of the kind more generally worn by ladies of forty than of
twenty-one. And it required a fine face and a good figure to carry
it off. Ladies will quite understand when I explain that Armorel
wore a train and bodice of green brocaded velvet: the sleeves and
the petticoat trimmed with lace. You may see a good deal of lace&mdash;of
a sort&mdash;on many dresses; but Philippa recognised with
astonishment that this was old lace, the finest lace in the world,
of greater breadth than it is now made&mdash;lace that was priceless&mdash;lace
that only a rich girl could wear. There were also pearls on
the sleeves: she wore mousquetaire gloves&mdash;which proved many
things: there were bracelets on her wrists, and round her neck
she had a circlet of plain red gold&mdash;it was the torque found in the
kistvaen on Samson, but this Philippa did not know. And she
observed, taking in all these details in one comprehensive and
catholic glance of mind and eye, that her cousin was a very beautiful
girl indeed, with something Castilian in her face and appearance&mdash;dark
and splendid. For a simple dinner she would have
been overdressed; but considering the reception to come afterwards,
she was fittingly arrayed. She was accompanied by her
companion&mdash;Philippa might have remembered that one must be
an heiress in order to afford the luxury of such a household official.
Mrs. Jerome Elstree was almost young enough to want a chaperon
for herself, being certainly a good deal under thirty. She was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
graceful woman of fair complexion and blue eyes: if Armorel had
desired a contrast to herself she could not have chosen better.
She wore a dress in the style which is called, I believe, second
mourning. The dress suggested widowhood, but no longer in the
first passionate agony&mdash;widowhood subdued and resigned.</p>

<p>The hostess rose from her chair and advanced a step to meet
her guests. She touched the fingers of Mrs. Elstree. 'Very
pleased, indeed,' she murmured, and turned to Armorel. 'My
dear cousin'&mdash;she seized both her hands, and looked as well as
spoke most motherly. 'My dear child, this is, indeed, a pleasure!
And to think that we have known nothing about your very existence
all the time! This is my daughter&mdash;my only daughter,
Philippa.' Then she subsided into her chair, leaving Philippa to
do the rest. 'We are cousins,' said Philippa, kindly but with
cold and curious eyes. 'I hope we shall be friends.' Then she
turned to the companion. 'Oh!' she cried, with a start of surprise.
'It is Zoe!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mrs. Elstree, a quick smile on her lips. 'Formerly
it was Zoe. How do you do, Philippa?' Her voice was
naturally soft and sweet, a caressing voice, a voice of velvet. She
glanced at Philippa as she spoke, and her eyes flashed with a light
which hardly corresponded with the voice. 'I was wondering, as
we came here, whether you would remember me. It is so long
since we were at school together. How long, dear? Seven years?
Eight years? You remember that summer at the seaside&mdash;where
was it? One changes a good deal in seven years. Yet I thought,
somehow, that you would remember me. You are looking very
well, Philippa&mdash;still.'</p>

<p>A doubtful compliment, but conveyed in the softest manner,
which should have removed any possible doubt. Armorel looked
on with some astonishment. On Philippa's face there had risen
a flaming spot. Something was going on below the surface. But
Philippa laughed.</p>

<p>'Of course, I remember you very well,' she said.</p>

<p>'But, dear Philippa,' Mrs. Elstree went on, softly smiling and
gently speaking, 'I am no longer Zoe. I am Mrs. Jerome Elstree&mdash;I
am La Veuve Elstree. I am Armorel's companion.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry,' Philippa replied coldly. Her eyes belied her
words. She was not sorry. She did not care whether good or evil
had happened to this woman. She was too good a Christian to
desire the latter, and not good enough to wish the former. What
she had really hoped&mdash;whenever she thought of Zoe&mdash;was that she
might never, never meet her again. And here she was, a guest in
her own home, and companion to her own cousin!</p>

<p>Then Mr. Rosevean appeared, and welcomed the new cousin
cordially. He seemed a cheerful, good-tempered kind of man, was
sixty years of age, bald on the forehead, and of aspect like the conventional
Colonel of <i>Punch</i>&mdash;in fact, he had been in the Army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and served through the Crimean war, which was quite enough for
honour. He passed his time laboriously considering his investments&mdash;for
he had great possessions&mdash;and making small collections
which never came to anything. He also wrote letters to the papers,
but these seldom appeared.</p>

<p>Then they went in to dinner. The conversation naturally turned
at first upon Scilly, their common starting-point, and the illustrious
family of the Roseveans.</p>

<p>'As soon as I heard about you, my dear young lady, I set to
work to discover our exact relationship. My grandfather, Sir
Jacob&mdash;you have heard of Sir Jacob Rosevean, Knight of Hanover?
Yes; naturally&mdash;he was born in the year 1760. He was the younger
brother of Captain Emanuel Rosevean, your great-grandfather, I
believe.'</p>

<p>'My grandfathers were all named either Emanuel or Methusalem.
They took turns.'</p>

<p>'Quite so,' Mr. Rosevean nodded his head in approbation.
'The preservation of the same Christian names gives dignity to
the family. Anthony goes with Ashley: Emanuel or Methusalem
with Rosevean. The survival of the Scripture name shows how
the Puritanic spirit lingers yet in the good old stocks.' Philippa
glanced at her mother, mindful of her own remarks on the old
families of Scilly. 'We come of a very fine old family, cousin
Armorel. I hope you have been brought up in becoming pride of
birth. It is a possession which the world cannot give and the
world cannot take away. We are a race of Vikings&mdash;conquering
Vikings. The last of them was, perhaps, my grandfather, Sir
Jacob, unless any of the later Roseveans&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am afraid they can hardly be called Vikings,' said Armorel,
simply.</p>

<p>'Sir Jacob&mdash;my grandfather&mdash;was cast, my dear young friend,
in the heroic mould&mdash;the heroic mould. Nothing short of that.
For the services which he rendered to the State at the moment
of Britannia's greatest peril, he should have been raised to the
House of Lords. But it was a time of giants&mdash;and he had to be
contented with the simple recognition of a knighthood.'</p>

<p>'Jacob Rosevean'&mdash;who was it had told Armorel this&mdash;long
before? And why did she now remember the words so clearly,
'ran away and went to sea. He could read and write and cipher
a little, and so they made him clerk to the purser. Then he rose
to be purser himself, and when he had made some money he left
the service and became Contractor to the Fleet, and supplied stores
of all kinds during the long war, and at last he became so rich that
they were obliged to make him a Knight.'</p>

<p>'The simple recognition of a Knighthood,' Mr. Rosevean went
on. 'This it is to live in an age of heroes.'</p>

<p>Armorel waited for further details. Later on, perhaps, some of
the heroic achievements of the great Sir Jacob would be related.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Meantime, every hero must make a beginning: why should not Jacob
Rosevean begin as purser's clerk? It was pleasing to the girl to
observe how large and generous a view her cousins took of the
family greatness&mdash;never before had she known to what an illustrious
stock she belonged. The smuggling, the wrecking, the piloting,
the farming&mdash;these were all forgotten. A whole race of heroic
ancestors had taken the place of the plain Roseveans whom Armorel
knew. Well: if by the third generation of wealth and position
one cannot evolve so simple a thing as an ancient family, what is
the use of history, genealogy, heraldry, and imagination? The
Roseveans were Vikings: they were the terror of the French coast:
they went a-crusading with short-legged Robert: they were rovers
of the Spanish Main: the great King of Spain trembled when he
heard their name: they were buccaneers. Portraits of some of these
ancestors hung on the wall: Sir Jacob himself, of course, was there;
and Sir Jacob's great-grandfather, a Cavalier; and his grandfather,
an Elizabethan worthy. Presumably, these portraits came from
Samson Island. But Armorel had never heard of any family portraits,
and she had grown up in shameful ignorance of these heroes.
There was a coat-of-arms, too, with which she was not acquainted.
Yet there were circumstances connected with the grant of that shield
by the Sovereign&mdash;King Edward the First&mdash;which were highly
creditable to the family. Armorel listened and marvelled. But
her host evidently believed it all: and, indeed, it was his father,
not himself, who had imagined these historic splendours.</p>

<p>'It is pleasing,' he said, 'to revive these memories between
members of different branches. You, however, are fresh from the
ancestral scenes. You are the heiress of the ancient island home:
yours is the Hall of the Vikings: to you have been entrusted the
relics of the past. I look upon you and seem to see again the
Rovers putting forth to drag down the Spanish pride. There are
noble memories, Armorel&mdash;I must call you Armorel&mdash;associated
with that isle of Samson, our ancient family domain. Let us never
forget them.'</p>

<p>The dinner came to an end at last, and the ladies went away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elstree sat down in the most comfortable chair by the fire
and was silent, leaning her face upon her hands and looking into
the firelight. Mrs. Rosevean took a chair on the other side and
fell asleep. Philippa and Armorel talked.</p>

<p>'I cannot understand,' said Philippa, bluntly, 'how such a girl
as you could have come from Scilly. I have been reading a book
about the place, and it says that the people are all poor, and that
Samson, your island&mdash;our island&mdash;is quite a small place.'</p>

<p>'I will tell you if you like,' said Armorel, 'as much about
myself as you please to hear.' The chief advantage of an autobiography&mdash;as
you shall see, dear reader, if you will oblige me by
reading mine, when it comes out&mdash;is the right of preserving silence
upon certain points. Armorel, for example, said nothing at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
about Roland Lee. Nor did she tell of the chagreen case with the
rubies. But she did tell how she found the treasure of the sea-chest,
and the cupboard, and how she took everything, except the
punch-bowls and the silver ship and cups, to London, and how she
gave them over to the lawyer to whom she had a letter. And she
told how she was resolved to repair the deficiencies of her up-bringing,
and how, for five long years, she had worked day and night.</p>

<p>'I think you are a very brave girl,' said Philippa. 'Most girls
in your place would have been contented to sit down and enjoy
their good fortune.'</p>

<p>'I was so very ignorant when I began. And&mdash;and one or two
things had happened which made me ashamed of my ignorance.'</p>

<p>'Yet it was brave of you to work so hard.'</p>

<p>'At first,' said Armorel, 'when this good fortune came to me I
was afraid, thinking of the Parable of the Rich Man.' Philippa
started and looked astonished. In the circle of Dives this Parable
is never mentioned. No one regardeth that Parable, which is
generally believed to be a late interpolation. 'But when I came
to think, I understood that it might be the gift of the Five Talents&mdash;a
sacred trust.'</p>

<p>Philippa's eyes showed no comprehension of this language.
Armorel, indeed, had learned long since that the Bryanite or Early
Christian language is no longer used in society. But Philippa was
her cousin. Perhaps, in the family, it would still pass current.</p>

<p>'I worked most at music. Shall I play to you?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, dear Philippa,' said Zoe, half-turning round, 'would
please you so much as to hear Armorel play. You used to play a
little yourself'&mdash;Philippa had been the pride and glory of the school
for her playing&mdash;'A little!' Had she lost her memory?</p>

<p>'Will you play this evening?'</p>

<p>'I brought her violin in the carriage,' said Zoe, softly. 'I
wanted to give you as many delightful surprises as possible,
Philippa. To find your cousin so beautiful: to hear her play:
and to receive me again! This will be, indeed, an evening to
remember.'</p>

<p>'I will play if you like,' said Armorel, simply. 'But perhaps
you have made other arrangements.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;you can play? But of course, you have had good
masters. You shall play instead of me.'</p>

<p>Zoe murmured her satisfaction, and turned again her face to
the fire.</p>

<p>'Tell me, Armorel,' said Philippa, 'all this about the Vikings&mdash;the
Hall of the Vikings&mdash;the Rovers&mdash;and the rest of it. Was
it familiar to you?'</p>

<p>'No; I have never heard of any Vikings or Rovers. And there
is no Hall.'</p>

<p>'We are, I suppose, really an old family of Scilly?'</p>

<p>'We have lived in the same place for I know not how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
years. One of the outlying rocks of Scilly is called Rosevean.
Oh! there is no doubt about our antiquity. About the Crusaders,
and all the rest of it, I know nothing. Perhaps because there was
nobody to tell me.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Philippa, thoughtfully. 'Well, it does no harm
to believe these things. Perhaps some of them are true. Sir
Jacob, certainly, cannot be denied; nor the Roseveans of Samson
Island. My dear, I am very glad you came.'</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II_2" id="CHAPTER_II_2"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE SONATA</small></h2>


<p>The room was full of people. It was the average sort of reception,
where one always expects to meet men and women who have done
something: men who write, paint, or compose; women who do the
same, but not so well; women who play and sing; women who are
æsthetic, and show their appreciation of art by wearing hideous
dresses; women who recite: men and women who advocate all
kinds of things&mdash;mostly cranks and cracks. There are, besides, the
people who know the people who do things: and these, who are a
talkative and appreciative folk, carry on the conversation. Thirdly,
there are the people who do nothing, and know nobody, who go
away and talk casually of having met this or that great man last
night.</p>

<p>'Armorel,' said Philippa, 'let me introduce Dr. Bovey-Tracy.
Perhaps you already know his works.'</p>

<p>'Unfortunately&mdash;not yet,' Armorel replied.</p>

<p>The Doctor was quite a young man, not more than two- or three-and-twenty.
His degree was German, and his appearance, with long
light hair and spectacles, was studiously German. If he could have
Germanised his name as well as his appearance he would certainly
have done so. As a pianist, a teacher of music, and a composer,
the young Doctor is already beginning to be known. When Armorel
confessed her ignorance, he gently spread his hands and smiled
pity. 'If you will really play, Armorel, Dr. Bovey-Tracy will
kindly accompany you.'</p>

<p>Armorel took her violin out of the case and began to tune it.</p>

<p>'What will you play?' asked the musician: 'Something serious?
So?'</p>

<p>Armorel turned over a pile of music and selected a piece. It
was the Sonata by Schumann in D minor for violin and pianoforte.
'Shall we play this?'</p>

<p>Philippa looked a little surprised. The choice was daring.
The Herr Doctor smiled graciously: 'This is, indeed, serious,' he
said.</p>

<p>I suppose that to begin your musical training with the performance
of heys and hornpipes and country dances is not the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
scientific method. But he who learns to fiddle for sailors to dance
may acquire a mastery over the instrument which the modern
scientific method teaches much more slowly. Armorel began her
musical training with a fiddle as obedient to her as the Slave of
the Lamp to his master. And for five years she had been under
masters playing every day, until&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The pianist sat down, held his outstretched fingers professionally
over the keys, and struck a chord. Armorel raised her bow,
and the sonata began.</p>

<p>I am told that there is now quite a fair percentage of educated
people who really do understand music, can tell good playing from
bad, and fine playing from its counterfeit. In the same way, there
is a percentage&mdash;but not nearly so large&mdash;of people who know a
good picture when they see it, and can appreciate correct drawing
if they cannot understand fine colour. Out of the sixty or seventy
people who filled this room, there were certainly twenty&mdash;but then
it was an exceptionally good collection&mdash;who understood that a
violinist born and trained was playing to them, in a style not often
found outside St. James's Hall. And they marvelled while the
music delivered its message&mdash;which is different for every soul.
They sat or stood in silence, spellbound. Of the remaining fifty,
thirty understood that a piece of classical music was going on: it
had no voice or message for them: they did not comprehend one
single phrase&mdash;the sonata might have been a sermon in the Bulgarian
tongue: but they knew how to behave in the presence of Music,
and they governed themselves accordingly. The Remnant&mdash;twenty
in number&mdash;containing all the young men and most of the girls,
understood that here was a really beautiful girl playing the fiddle
for them. The young men murmured their admiration, and the
girls whispered envious things&mdash;not necessarily spiteful, but certainly
envious. What girl could resist envy at sight of that dress,
with its lace, and that command of the violin, and&mdash;which every
girl concedes last of all, and grudgingly&mdash;that face and figure?</p>

<p>Philippa stood beside the piano, rather pale. She knew, now,
why her old schoolfellow had been so anxious that Armorel should
play. Kind and thoughtful Zoe!</p>

<p>The playing of the first movement surprised her. Here was
one who had, indeed, mastered her instrument. At the playing of
the second, which is a scherzo, bright and lively, she acknowledged
her mistress&mdash;not her rival. At the playing of the third, which
contains a lovely, simple, innocent, and happy tune, her heart
melted&mdash;never, never, could she so pour into her playing the soul
of that melody: never could she so rise to the spirit of the
musician and put into the music what even he himself had not
imagined. But Zoe was wrong. Her soul was not filled with
envy. Philippa had a larger soul.</p>

<p>It was finished. The twenty who understood gasped. The
thirty who listened murmured thanks, and resumed their talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
about something else. The twenty who neither listened nor
understood went on talking without any comment at all.</p>

<p>'You have had excellent masters,' said the Doctor. 'You play
very well indeed&mdash;not like an amateur. It is a pity that you
cannot play in public.'</p>

<p>'You have made good use of your opportunities,' said Philippa.
'I have never heard an amateur play better. I play a little
myself; but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I said you would be pleased,' Zoe murmured softly at her
side. 'I knew you would be pleased when you heard Armorel play.'</p>

<p>'You will play yourself, presently?' said the Herr Doctor.</p>

<p>'No; not this evening,' Philippa replied. 'Impossible&mdash;after
Armorel.'</p>

<p>'Not this evening!' echoed Zoe, sweetly.</p>

<p>Then there came walking tall and erect through the crowd,
which respectfully parted right and left to let him pass, a young
man of striking and even distinguished appearance.</p>

<p>'Philippa,' he said, 'will you introduce me to your cousin?'</p>

<p>'Armorel, this is another cousin of mine&mdash;unfortunately not of
yours&mdash;Mr. Alec Feilding.'</p>

<p>'I am very unfortunate, Miss Rosevean. I came too late to
hear more than the end of the sonata. Normann-Néruda herself
could not interpret that music better.' Then he saw Zoe, and
greeted her as an old friend. 'Mrs. Elstree and I,' he said, 'have
known each other a long time.'</p>

<p>'Fifty years, at least,' Zoe murmured. 'Is it not so long,
Philippa?'</p>

<p>'Will you play something else?' he asked. 'The people are
dying to hear you again.'</p>

<p>Armorel looked at Philippa. 'If you will,' she said kindly.
'If you are not tired. Play us, this time, something lighter.
We cannot all appreciate Schumann.'</p>

<p>'Shall I give you a memory of Scilly?' she replied. 'That
will be light enough.'</p>

<p>She played, in fact, that old ditty&mdash;one of those which she had
been wont to play for the Ancient Lady&mdash;called 'Prince Rupert's
March.' She played this with variations which that gallant
Cavalier had never heard. It is a fine air, however, and lends
itself to the phantasy of a musician. Then those who had understood
the sonata laughed with condescension, as a philosopher
laughs when he hears a simple story; and those who had pretended
to understand pricked up their ears, thinking that this was
another piece of classical music, and joyfully perceiving that they
would understand it; and those who had made no pretence now
listened with open mouths and ears as upright as those of any
wild-ass of the desert. Music worth hearing, this. Armorel played
for five or six minutes. Then she stopped and laid down her violin.</p>

<p>'I think I have played enough for one evening,' she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>She left the piano and retired into the throng. A girl took her
place. The Herr Doctor placed another piece of music before him,
lifted his hands, held them suspended for a moment, and then
struck a chord. This girl began to sing.</p>

<p>Mr. Alec Feilding followed Armorel and led her to a seat at the
end of the room. Then he sat down beside her and, as soon as the
song was finished, began to talk.</p>

<p>He began by talking about music, and the Masters in music.
His talk was authoritative: he laid down opinions: he talked as if
he was writing a book of instruction: and he talked as if the
whole wide world was listening to him. But not quite so loudly
as if that had been really the case.</p>

<p>He was a man of thirty or so, his features were perfectly regular,
but his expression was rather wooden. His eyes were good, but
rather too close together. His mouth was hidden by a huge moustache,
curled and twisted and pointed forwards.</p>

<p>Armorel disliked his manner, and for some reason or other distrusted
his face.</p>

<p>He left off laying down the law on music, and began to talk
about things personal.</p>

<p>'I hope you like your new companion,' he said. 'She is an
old friend of mine. I was in hopes of being able to advance her
husband in his profession. But he died before I got the chance.
Mr. Jagenal told me what was wanted, and I was happy in recommending
Zoe&mdash;Mrs. Elstree.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Armorel, coldly. 'I dare say we shall get
to like each other in time.'</p>

<p>'If so, I shall rejoice in having been of some service to you as
well as to her. What is her day at home?'</p>

<p>'I believe we are to be at home on Wednesdays.'</p>

<p>'As for me,' he said lightly, 'I am always at home in my
studio. I am a triple slave&mdash;Miss Rosevean&mdash;as you may have
heard. I am a slave of the brush, the pen, and the wastepaper-basket.
If you will come with Mrs. Elstree to my studio I can
show you one or two things that you might like to see.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' she replied, without apparent interest in his
studio. The young man was not accustomed to girls who showed
no interest in him, and retired, chilled. Presently she heard his
voice again. This time he was talking with Philippa. They were
talking low in the doorway beside her, but she could not choose
but hear.</p>

<p>'You recommended her&mdash;you?' said Philippa.</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Do you know how&mdash;where&mdash;she has been living for the last
seven years?'</p>

<p>'Certainly. She married an American. He died a year ago,
leaving her rather badly off. Is there any reason, Philippa, why I
should not recommend her? If there is I will speak to Mr. Jagenal.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;no. There is no reason that I know of. Somebody
told me she had gone on the stage. Who was it?'</p>

<p>'Gone on the stage? No&mdash;no: she was married to this
American.'</p>

<p>'You have never spoken to me about her.'</p>

<p>'Reason enough, fair cousin. You do not like her.'</p>

<p>'And&mdash;you&mdash;do,' she replied slowly.</p>

<p>'I like all pretty women, Philippa. I respect one only.'</p>

<p>Then other people came and were introduced to Armorel. One
does not leave in cold neglect a girl who is so beautiful and plays
so wonderfully. None of them interested Armorel very much.
At the beginning, when a girl first goes into society, she expects to
be interested and excited at a general gathering. This expectation
disappears, and the current coin of everybody's talk takes the place
of interest.</p>

<p>Suddenly she caught a face which she knew. When a girl has
been travelling about for five years she sees a great many faces.
This was a face which she remembered perfectly well, yet could not
at first place it in any scene or assign it to any date. Then she
recollected. And she walked boldly across the room and stood
before the owner of that face.</p>

<p>'You have forgotten me,' she said abruptly.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I&mdash;can I ever have known you?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Will you shake hands, Mr. Stephenson? You were Dick
Stephenson five years ago. Have you forgotten Armorel, of Samson
Island in Scilly?'</p>

<p>No. He had not forgotten that young lady. But he would
never have known her thus changed&mdash;thus dressed.</p>

<p>'Where is your friend Roland Lee?'</p>

<p>Dick Stephenson changed colour. 'I have not seen him for a
long time. We are no longer&mdash;exactly&mdash;friends.'</p>

<p>'Why not?' she asked, with severity. 'Have you done anything
bad? How have you offended him?'</p>

<p>'No, no; certainly not.' He coloured more deeply. 'I have
done nothing bad at all,' he added with much indignation.</p>

<p>'Have you deserted him, then? I thought men never gave up
their friends. Come to see me, Mr. Stephenson. You shall tell
me where he is and what he is doing.'</p>

<p>In the press of the crowd, as they were going away, she heard
Mr. Jagenal's voice.</p>

<p>'You are burning the candle at both ends, Alec,' he was saying.
'You cannot possibly go on painting, writing, editing your paper,
riding in the Park, and going out every evening as you do now.
No man's constitution can stand it, young gentleman. Curb your
activity. Be wise in time.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III_2" id="CHAPTER_III_2"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE CLEVEREST MAN IN LONDON</small></h2>


<p>Alec Feilding&mdash;everybody, even those who had never seen him,
called him Alec&mdash;stood before the fire in his own den. In his
hand he held a manuscript, which he was reading with great care,
making dabs and dashes on it with a thick red pencil.</p>

<p>Sometimes he called the place his studio, sometimes his study.
No other man in London, I believe, has so good a right to call his
workshop by either name. No other man in London, certainly, is
so well known both for pen and pencil. To be at once a poet, a
novelist, an essayist, and a painter, and to do all these things well,
if not splendidly, is given to few.</p>

<p>The room was large and lofty, as becomes a studio. A heavy
curtain hung across the door: the carpet was thick: there was a
great fireplace, as deep and broad as that of an old hall, the fire
burning on bricks in the ancient style. Above the fireplace there
was no modern overmantel, but dark panels of oak, carved in
flowers and grapes, with a coat of arms&mdash;his own: he claimed
descent from the noble House of Feilding: and in the centre panel
his own portrait let into the wall without a frame&mdash;the work was
executed by the most illustrious portrait-painter of the day&mdash;the
face full of thought, the eyes charged with feeling, the features
clear, regular, and classical. A beautiful portrait, with every point
idealised. Three sides of the room were fitted with bookshelves,
as becomes a study, and these were filled with books. The fourth
side was partly hung with tapestry and partly adorned with armour
and weapons. Here were also two small pictures, representing the
illustrious Alec in childhood&mdash;the light of future genius already in
his eyes&mdash;and in early manhood.</p>

<p>A large library table, littered with books, manuscripts, and
proofs, belonged to the study. An easel before the north light,
and another table provided with palettes, brushes, paints, and all
the tools of the limning trade, belonged to the studio.</p>

<p>The house, which was in St. John's Wood, stood in an old garden
at the end of a cul-de-sac off the main road: it was, therefore,
quiet: the house itself was new, built in the style now familiar,
and put up for the convenience of those who believe that there is
nothing in the world to be considered except Art. Therefore there
was a spacious hall: stairs broad enough for an ancient mansion
led to the first floor and to the great studio. There were also
three or four small cupboards, called bedrooms, dining-room, and
anything else you might please. But the studio was the real thing.
The house was built for the studio.</p>

<p>The place was charged with an atmosphere of peace. Intellectual
calm reigned here. Art of all kinds abhors noise. One could
feel here the silence necessary for intellectual efforts of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
order. Apart from the books and the easel and this silence, the
character of the occupant was betrayed&mdash;or perhaps proclaimed&mdash;by
other things. The furniture was massive: the library table of
the largest kind: the easy chairs by the fire as solid and comfortable
as if they had been designed for a club smoking-room: a
cabinet showed a collection of china behind glass: the appointments,
down to the inkstand and the paper-knife, were large and
solid: all together spoke not only of the artist but of the successful
artist: not only of the man who works, but of one who works
with success and honour: the man arrived. The things also spoke
of the splendid man, the man who knows that success should be
followed by the splendid life. Too often the successful man is a
poor-spirited creature, who continues in the humble middle-class
style to which he was born; is satisfied with his suburban villa,
never wants a better house or one more finely appointed, and has
no craving for society. What is success worth if one does not live
up to it? Success is not an end: it is the means: it brings the
power of getting the things that make life&mdash;wine&mdash;horses&mdash;the
best cook at the best club&mdash;sport&mdash;the society, every day, of
beautiful and well-bred women&mdash;all these things the man who has
succeeded can enjoy. Those who have not yet succeeded may
envy the favourite of Fortune.</p>

<p>As for his work, this highly successful man owned that he could
not desert the Muse of Painting any more than her sister of Belles-Lettres.
Happy would he be with either, were t'other dear
charmer away! Happier still was he with both! And they were
not jealous. They allowed him&mdash;these tender creatures&mdash;to love
them both. He was by nature polygamous, perhaps.</p>

<p>Therefore those who were invited to see his latest picture&mdash;the
lucky few, because you must not think that his studio was open on
Show Sunday for all the world to see&mdash;stayed, when they had
admired that production, to talk of his latest poem or his latest
story.</p>

<p>Over the mantelshelf was quite a stack of invitations. And
really one hardly knows whether Alec Feilding was most to be
envied for his success as a painter&mdash;though he painted little: or
for his stories&mdash;though these were all short&mdash;much too short: or
for his verses&mdash;certainly written in the most delightful vein of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers de société</i>: or for his essays, full of observation: or for his
social success, which was undoubted. And there is no doubt that
there was not any man in London more envied, or who occupied a
more enviable position, than Alec Feilding. To be sure, he
deserved it: because, without any exception, he was the cleverest
man in town.</p>

<p>He owned and edited a paper of his own&mdash;a weekly journal
devoted to the higher interests of Art. It was called <i>The Muses
Nine</i>. It was illustrated especially by blocks from art books noticed
in its columns. In this paper his own things first appeared: his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
verses, his stories, his essays. The columns signed <i>Editor</i> were the
leading feature of the paper, for which alone many people bought
it every week. The contents of these columns were always fresh,
epigrammatic, and delightful: in the stories a certain feminine
quality lent piquancy&mdash;it seemed sometimes as if a man could not
have written these stories: the verses always tripped lightly, merrily,
and gracefully along. An Abbé de la Cour in the last century
might have served up such a weekly dish for the Parisians, had he
been the cleverest man in Paris.</p>

<p>Alec Feilding's enemies&mdash;every man who is rising or has risen
has enemies&mdash;consoled themselves for a success which could not be
denied by sneering at the ephemeral character of his work. It was
for to-day: to-morrow, they said, it would be flat. This was not
quite true, but, as it is equally true of nearly every piece of modern
work, the successful author could afford to disregard this criticism.
Perhaps there may be, here and there, a writer who expects more
than a limited immortality: I do not know any, but there may be
some. And these will probably be disappointed. The enemies
said further that his social success&mdash;also undoubted&mdash;was due to
his unbounded cheek. This, too, was partly true, because, if one
would rise at all, one must possess that useful quality: without it
one will surely sink. It is not to be denied that this young man
walked into drawing-rooms as if his presence was a favour: that he
spoke as one who delivers a judgment: and that he professed a
profound belief in himself. With such gifts and graces&mdash;the gift
of painting, the gift of verse, the gift of fiction, a handsome presence,
good manners, and unbounded cheek&mdash;Alec Feilding had already
risen very high indeed for so young a man. His enemies, again,
said that he was looking out for an heiress.</p>

<p>His enemies, as sometimes but not often happens, spoke from
imperfect knowledge. Every man has his weak points, and should
be careful to keep them to himself&mdash;friends may become enemies&mdash;and
to let no one know them or suspect them. As for the weak
points of Alec Feilding&mdash;had his enemies known them&mdash;&mdash; But
you shall see.</p>

<p>He sat down at his library-table and began to copy the manuscript
that he had been reading. It was a laborious task, first
because copying work is always tedious, and next because he was
making alterations&mdash;changing names and places&mdash;and leaving out
bits. He worked on steadily for about half an hour.</p>

<p>Then there was a gentle tap at the door, and his servant&mdash;who
looked as solemn and discreet as if he had been Charles the Second's
confidential clerk of the Back-stairs&mdash;came in noiselessly on tiptoe
and whispered a name. Alec placed the manuscript and his copy
carefully in a drawer, and nodded his head.</p>

<p>You have already seen the man who came in. Five years older,
and a good deal altered&mdash;changed, perhaps, for the worse&mdash;but then
the freshness of twenty-one cannot be expected to last. The man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
who stayed three weeks in Samson, and promised a girl that he
would return. The man who broke that promise, and forgot the
girl. He never went back to Scilly. Perhaps he had grown handsomer:
his Vandyke beard and moustache were by this time thicker
and longer: he was more picturesque in appearance than of old:
he still wore a brown velvet coat: he looked still more what he
was&mdash;an artist. But his cheek was thin and pale, dark rings were
round his eyes, his face was gloomy: he wore the look of waste&mdash;the
waste of energy and of purpose. It is not good to see this look
in the eyes of a young man.</p>

<p>'You sent for me,' he said, with no other greeting.</p>

<p>'I did. Come in. Is the door shut? I've got some good news
for you. Heavens! you look as if you wanted good news badly!
What's the matter, man? More debts and duns? And I want to
consult you a little about this picture of yours'&mdash;he pointed to the
easel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="452" height="600" alt="&#39;I want to consult you a little about this picture
of yours.&#39;" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>&#39;I want to consult you a little about this picture
of yours.&#39;</i></span>
</div>

<p>'Mine? No: yours. You have bought me&mdash;pictures and
all.'</p>

<p>'Just as you like. What does it matter&mdash;here&mdash;within these
walls?'</p>

<p>'Hush! Even here you should not whisper it. The birds of
the air, you know&mdash;&mdash; Take great care'&mdash;&mdash; Roland laughed,
but not mirthfully. 'Mine?' he repeated; 'mine? Suppose I
were to call together the fellows at the club, and suppose I were to
tell the story of the last three years?&mdash;eh? eh? How a man was
fooled on until he sold himself and became a slave&mdash;eh?'</p>

<p>'You can't tell that story, Roland, you know.'</p>

<p>'Some day I will&mdash;I must.'</p>

<p>Alec Feilding threw himself back in his chair, crossed his legs,
and joined his fingers. It is an attitude of judicial remonstrance.</p>

<p>'Come, Roland,' he said, smiling blandly. 'Let us have it out.
It galls sometimes, doesn't it? But remember you can't have
everything&mdash;come, now. If you were to tell the fellows at the
club, truthfully, the whole story, they would, I dare say, be glad
to get such a beautiful pile of stones to throw at me. One more
reputation built on pretence and humbug&mdash;eh? Yes: the little
edifice which you and I have reared together with so much care
would be shattered at a single stroke, wouldn't it? You could do
that: you can always do that. But at some little cost to yourself&mdash;some
little cost, remember.'</p>

<p>Roland remarked that the cost or consequences of that little
exploit might be condemned.</p>

<p>'Truly. If you will. But not until you realise what they are.
Now my version of the story is this. There was once&mdash;three years
ago&mdash;a fellow who had failed. The Academy wouldn't accept his
pictures; no one would buy them. And yet he had some power
and true feeling. But he could not succeed: he could not get anybody
to buy his pictures. And then he was an extravagant kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of man: he was head over ears in debt: he liked to lead the easy
life&mdash;dinner and billiards at the club&mdash;all the rest of it. Then
there was another man&mdash;an old schoolfellow of his&mdash;a man who
wanted, for purposes of his own, a reputation for genius in more
than one branch of Art. He wanted to seem a master of painting
as well as poetry and fiction. This man addressed the Failure.
He said, "Unsuccessful Greatness, I will buy your pictures of you,
on the simple condition that I may call them mine." The Failure
hesitated at first. Naturally. He was loth to write himself down
a Failure. Everybody would be. Then he consented. He
promised to paint no more in the style in which he had failed
except for this other man. Then the other man, who knew his
way about, called his friends together, set up a picture painted by
the Failure on an easel, bought the tools, laid them out on the
table&mdash;there they are&mdash;and launched himself upon the world as an
artist as well as a poet and author. A Fraud, wasn't he? Yet it
paid both men&mdash;the Fraud and the Failure. For the Fraud knew
how to puff the work and to get it puffed and praised and noticed
everywhere; he made people talk about it: he had paragraphs
about it: he got critics to treat his&mdash;or the Failure's&mdash;pictures
seriously: in fact, he advertised them as successfully and as
systematically as if he had been a soap-man. Is this true, so far?'</p>

<p>'Quite true. Go on&mdash;Fraud.'</p>

<p>'I will&mdash;Failure. Then the price of the pictures went up.
The Fraud was able to sell them at a price continually rising.
And the Failure received a price in proportion. He shared in the
proceeds. The Fraud gave him two thirds. Is that true? Two
thirds. He ran your price, Failure, from nothing at all to four
hundred and fifty pounds&mdash;your last, and biggest price. And he
gave you two thirds. All you had to do was to produce the pictures.
What he did was to persuade the world that they were great and
valuable pictures. Is that true?'</p>

<p>Roland grunted.</p>

<p>'Three years ago you were at your wits' end for the next day's
dinner. You had borrowed of all your friends: you had pawned
your watch and chain: you were face to face with poverty&mdash;no;
starvation. Deny that, if you can.' He turned fiercely on Roland.
'You can't deny it. What are you now? You have a good income:
you dine every day on the best of everything: you do yourself
well in every respect. Hang it, Roland, you are an ungrateful
dog!'</p>

<p>'You have ruined my life. You have robbed me of my name.'</p>

<p>'Let us stop heroics. If you are useful to me, I am ten times
as useful to you. Because, my dear boy, without me you cannot
live. Without you I can do very well. Indeed, I have only to
find another starving genius&mdash;there are plenty about&mdash;in order to
keep up my reputation as a painter. Go to the club. Call the
men together. Tell them if you like, and what you like. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
have no proofs. I can deny it, and I can give you the sack, and
I can get that other starving genius to carry on the work.'</p>

<p>Roland made no reply.</p>

<p>'Why, my dear fellow&mdash;why should we quarrel? What does it
matter about a little reputation? What is the good of your precious
name to you when you are dead? Here you are&mdash;painting
better and better every day&mdash;your price rising&mdash;your position more
assured&mdash;what on earth can any man want more? As for me, you
are useful to me. If you were not, I should put an end to the
arrangement. That is understood. Very well, then. Enough
said. Now, if you please, we will look at the picture.'</p>

<p>He got up and walked across the room to the easel. Roland
followed submissively, with hanging head. He staggered as he
went: not with strong drink, but with the rage that tore his heart.</p>

<p>'It is really a very beautiful thing,' said the cleverest man in
all London, looking at it critically. 'I think that even you have
never done anything quite so good.'</p>

<p>The picture showed a great rock rising precipitous from the
sea&mdash;at its base was a reef or projecting shelf. The shags stood in
a line on the top of the rock: the sea-gulls flew around the rock
and sailed merrily before the breeze: there was a little sea on, but
not much: a boat with a young man in it lay off the rock, and a
girl was on the reef standing among the long yellow sea-weed: the
spray flew up the sides of the rock: the sun was sinking. What
was it but one of Roland's sketches made in the Outer Islands,
with Armorel for his companion?</p>

<p>'It is very good, Roland,' Alec repeated. 'If I am not so good
a painter myself, I am not envious. I can appreciate and acknowledge
good work.' Under the circumstances, rather an extraordinary
speech. But Roland's gloomy face softened a little. Even at such
a moment the artist feels the power of praise. The other, standing
before the picture, watched the softening of the face. 'Good
work?' he repeated by way of question. 'Man! it is splendid
work! I can feel the breath of the salt breeze: I can see the
white spray flying over the rock: the girl stands out real and
living. It is a splendid piece of work, Roland.'</p>

<p>'I think it is better than the last,' the unlucky painter replied
huskily.</p>

<p>'I should rather think it is. I expect to get a great name for
this picture'&mdash;the painter winced&mdash;'and you&mdash;you&mdash;the painter,
will get a much more solid thing&mdash;you will get a big cheque. I've
sold it already. No dealers this time. It has been bought by a
rich American. Three hundred is the figure I can offer you. And
here's your cheque.'</p>

<p>He took it, ready drawn and signed, from his pocket-book.
Roland Lee received it, but he let it drop from his fingers: the
paper fluttered to the floor. He gazed upon the picture in silence.</p>

<p>'Well? What are you thinking of?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>'I was thinking of the day when I made the sketch for that
picture. I remember what the girl said to me.'</p>

<p>'What the devil does it matter what the girl said? All we care
about is the picture.'</p>

<p>'I remember her very words. You who have bought the
picture can see the girl; but I, who painted it, can hear her
voice.'</p>

<p>'You are not going off into heroics again?'</p>

<p>'No, no. Don't be afraid. I am not going to tell you what
she said. Only I told her, being pleased with what she told me,
that she was a prophetess. Nobody ought ever to prophesy good
things about a man, for they never come to pass. Let them
prophesy disappointment and ruin and shame, and then they
always come true. My God! what a prophecy was hers! And
what has come of it? I have sold my genius, which is my soul. I
have traded it away. It is the sin unforgiven in this world and in
the next.'</p>

<p>'When you give over tragedy and blank verse&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! I have done.'</p>

<p>'I should like to ask you a question.'</p>

<p>'Ask it.'</p>

<p>'The foreground&mdash;the sea-weeds lying over the boulders. Does
the light fall quite naturally? I hardly understand&mdash;look here.
If the sunlight&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<em>You</em> to pretend to be a painter!' Roland snorted impatiently.
'<em>You</em> to talk about lights and shadows! Man alive! I wonder
you haven't been found out ages ago! The light falls this way&mdash;this
way&mdash;see!'&mdash;he turned the painting about to show how it
fell.</p>

<p>'Oh! I understand. Yes, yes; I see now.' Alec seemed not
to resent this language of contempt.</p>

<p>'Is there anything else you want to know before I go? Perhaps
you wish the sea painted black?'</p>

<p>'Cornish coast again, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Somewhere that way. What does it matter where you put it?
Call it a view on Primrose Hill.'</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up the cheque. He looked at it
savagely for a moment as if he would like to tear it into a thousand
fragments. Then he crammed it into his pocket and turned
to go.</p>

<p>'My American,' said Alec, 'who rolls in money, is ready to buy
another. I think I can make an advance of fifty. Shall we say
three hundred and fifty? And shall we expect the painting in
three months or so? Before the summer holidays&mdash;say. You will
become rich, old man. As for this fellow, he is going to the New
Gallery. Go and gaze upon it, and say to yourself, "This was
worth, to me, three hundred&mdash;three hundred." How many men
at the club, Roland, can command three hundred for a picture?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Thirty is nearer their figure; and your own, dear boy, would have
continued to stand at double duck's egg if it had not been for me.
Trust me for running up your price. Our interests, my dear
Roland, are identical and indivisible. I think you are the only
painter in history whose name will remain unknown though his
works will live as long as the pigments keep their colour. Fortune is
yours, and fame is mine. You have got the best of the bargain.'</p>

<p>'Curse you and your bargain!'</p>

<p>'Pleasant words, Roland'&mdash;his face darkened. 'Pleasant
words, if you please, or perhaps ... I know, now, what is the
reason of this outbreak. I heard last night a rumour. You've
been taking opium again.'</p>

<p>'It isn't true. If it was, what does that matter to you?'</p>

<p>'This, my friend. The partnership exists only so long as the
work continues to improve. If bad habits spoil the quality of the
work I shall dissolve the partnership, and find that other starving
genius&mdash;plenty, plenty, plenty about. Nothing shakes the nerves
more quickly than opium. Nothing destroys the finer powers of
head and hand more surely. Don't let me hear any more
about opium. Don't fall into bad habits if you want to go on
making an income. And don't let me have to speak of this again.
Now, there is no more to be said, I think. Well, we part friends.
Ta-ta, dear boy.'</p>

<p>Roland flung himself out of the room with an interjection of
great strength not found in the school grammars.</p>

<p>Alec Feilding returned to his table. 'Roland's a great fool,'
he murmured. 'Because there isn't a gallery in London that
wouldn't jump at his pictures, and he could sell as fast as he could
paint. A great fool he is. But it would be very difficult for me
to find another man so good and such a fool. On fools and their
folly the wise man flourishes.'</p>

<small>MASTER OF ALL THE ARTS</small></h2>


<p>This unreasonable person dispatched, and the illustrious artist's
doubts about his lights and shadows dispelled, Alec Feilding
resumed his interrupted task. That is to say, he took the manuscript
out of the drawer and went on laboriously copying it. So
great a writer, whose time was so precious, might surely give out
his copying work. Lesser men do this. For half an hour he
worked on. Then the servant tapped at the door and came in
again, noiselessly as before, to whisper a name.</p>

<p>Alec nodded, and once more put back the manuscript in the
drawer.</p>

<p>The visitor was a young lady. She was of slight and slender
figure, dressed quite plainly, and even poorly, in a cloth jacket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and a stuff frock. Her gloves were shabby. Her features were
fine but not beautiful, the eyes bright, and the mouth mobile, but
the forehead too large for beauty. She carried a black leather roll
such as those who teach music generally carry about with them.
She was quite young, certainly not more than two-and-twenty.</p>

<p>'Effie?' He looked round, surprised.</p>

<p>'May I come in for two minutes? I will not stay longer.
Indeed, I should be so sorry to waste your time.'</p>

<p>'I am sure you would, Effie.' He gave her his hand, without
rising. 'Precious time&mdash;my time&mdash;there is so little of it. Therefore,
child&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have brought you,' she said, 'another little poem. I think
it is the kind of thing you like&mdash;in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers de société</i> style. She
unrolled her leather case and took out a very neatly written paper.</p>

<p>He read it slowly. Then he nodded his head approvingly and
read it aloud.</p>

<p>'How long does it take you to knock off this kind of thing,
Effie?'</p>

<p>'It took me the whole of yesterday. This morning I corrected
it and copied it out. Do you like it?'</p>

<p>'You are a clever little animal, Effie, and you shall make your
fortune. Yes; it is very good, very good indeed: Austin Dobson
himself is not better. It is very good: light, tripping, graceful&mdash;in
good taste. It is very good indeed. Leave it with me, Effie.
If I like it as well to-morrow as I do to-day, you may depend upon
seeing it in the next number.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she blushed a rosy red with the pleasure of being praised.
Indeed, it is a pleasure which never palls. The old man who has
been praised all his life is just as eager for more as the young
poet who is only just beginning. 'Oh! you really think it is good?'</p>

<p>'I do indeed. The best proof is that I am going to buy it of
you. It shall go into the editor's column&mdash;my own column&mdash;in
the place of honour.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she replied, but doubtfully&mdash;and she reddened again for
a different reason. 'Oh, Mr. Feilding,' she said with an effort, 'I
am so happy when I see my verses in print&mdash;in your paper&mdash;even
without my name. It makes me so proud that I hardly dare to
say what I want.'</p>

<p>'Say it, Effie. Get it off your mind. You will feel better
afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, it cannot be anything to you&mdash;so great and high,
with your beautiful stories and your splendid pictures. What is a
poor little set of verses to you?'</p>

<p>'Go on&mdash;go on.' His face clouded and his eyes hardened.</p>

<p>'In the paper it doesn't matter a bit. It is&mdash;it is&mdash;later&mdash;when
they come out all together in a little volume&mdash;with&mdash;with&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Go on, I say.' He sat upright, his chair half turned, his
hands on the arms, his face severe and judicial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>'With your name on the title-page.'</p>

<p>'Oh! that is troubling your mind, is it?'</p>

<p>'When the critics praise the poems and praise the poet&mdash;oh! is
it right, Mr. Feilding? Is it right?'</p>

<p>'Upon my word!' He pushed back his chair and rose, a tall
man of six feet, frowning angrily&mdash;so that the girl trembled and
tottered. 'Upon my word! This&mdash;from you! This from the girl
whom I have literally kept from starvation! Miss Effie Wilmot,
perhaps you will tell me what you mean! Haven't I bought your
verses? Haven't I polished and corrected them, and made them
fit to be seen? Am I not free to do what I please with my own?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;you buy them. But I&mdash;oh!&mdash;I write them!'</p>

<p>'Look here, child; I can have no nonsense. Before I took
these verses of you, had you any opening or market for them?'</p>

<p>'No. None at all.'</p>

<p>'Nobody would buy them. They were not even returned by
editors. They were thrown into the basket. Very well. I buy
them on the condition that I do what I please with them. I give
you three pounds&mdash;three pounds&mdash;for a poem, if it is good enough
for me to lick into shape. Then it becomes my own. It is a
bargain. When you leave off wanting money you will leave off
bringing me verses. Then I shall look for another girl. There are
thousands of girls about who can write verses as good as these.'</p>

<p>The girl remained silent. What her employer said was perfectly
true. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;it was not right.</p>

<p>'What more do you want?' he asked brutally.</p>

<p>'I am the author of these poems,' she said. 'And you are
not.'</p>

<p>'Within these walls I allow you to say so&mdash;this once. Take
care never to say so again. Outside these walls, if you say so, I
will bring an action against you for libel and slander and defamation
of character. Remember that. You had better, however,
take these verses and go away.' He flung them at her feet.
'We will put an end to the arrangement.'</p>

<p>'No, no&mdash;I consent.' She humbly stooped and picked them
up. 'Do what you like with them. I am too poor to refuse. Do
what you please.'</p>

<p>'It is your interest, certainly, to consent. Why, I paid you
last year a hundred pounds. A hundred pounds! There's an
income for a girl of twenty! Well, Effie, I forgive you. But no
more nonsense. And give over crying.' For now she was sobbing
and crying. 'Look here, Effie'&mdash;he laid his hand on hers&mdash;'some
day, before long, I will put your verses in another column, with
your name at the end&mdash;"Effie Wilmot." Come, will that do?'</p>

<p>'Oh! if you would! If you really would!'</p>

<p>'I really will, child. Don't think I care much about the thing.
What does it matter to me whether I am counted a writer of society
verses? It pleased me that the world should think me capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
these trifles while I am elaborating a really ambitious poem. One
more little volume and I shall have done. Besides, all this time
you are improving. When you burst upon the world it will be
with wings full-fledged and flight-sustained that you will soar to the
stars. Fair poetess, I will make your fame assured. Be comforted.'</p>

<p>She looked up, tearful and happy. 'Oh, forgive me!' she
said. 'Yes; I will do everything&mdash;exactly&mdash;as you want!'</p>

<p>'The world wants another poetess. You shall be that sweet
singer. Let me be the first to acknowledge the gift divine.' He
bowed and raised her hand and kissed the fingers of her shabby
glove.</p>

<p>'Now, child,' he said, 'your visit has gained you another three
pounds&mdash;here they are.'</p>

<p>She took the money, blushing again. The glowing prospect
warmed her heart. But the three golden sovereigns chilled her
again. She had parted with her child&mdash;her own. It was gone&mdash;and
he would call it his and pretend to be the father. And yet he
was going to make such splendid amends to her.</p>

<p>'How is your brother?'</p>

<p>'He is always the same. He works all day at his play. In the
afternoon he creeps out for a little on his crutches. In the future,
Mr. Feilding, we are both going to be happy, he with his dramas
and I with my poems.'</p>

<p>'Is his drama nearly ready?'</p>

<p>'Very nearly.'</p>

<p>'Tell him to let me read it. I can, at least, advise him.'</p>

<p>'If you will! Oh! you are so kind! What we should have
done without your help and the money you have given me, I do
not know.'</p>

<p>'You are welcome, sweet singer and heavenly poet.' The
great man took her hand and pressed it. 'Now be thankful that
you came here. You have cleared your mind of doubts, and
you know what awaits you in the future. Bring your brother's
little play. I should like&mdash;yes, I should like to see what sort of
a play he has written.'</p>

<p>She went away, happier for the prophecy. In the dead of night
she dreamed that she saw Mr. Alec Feilding carried along in a
triumphal car to the Temple of Fame. The goddess herself, flying
aloft in a white satin robe, blew the trumpet, and a nymph flying
lower down&mdash;in white linen&mdash;put on the laurel crown and held it
steady when the chariot bumped over the ruts. It was her crown&mdash;her
own&mdash;that adorned those brows. Is it right? she asked
again. Is it right?</p>

<p>Mr. Feilding, when she was gone, proceeded to copy out the
poem carefully in his own handwriting, adding a few erasures and
corrections so as to give the copy the hall-mark of the poet's study.
Then he threw the original upon the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>'There!' he said, 'if Miss Effie Wilmot should have the audacity
to claim these things as her own, at least I have the originals in
my own handwriting&mdash;with my own corrections upon them, too,
as they were sent to the printer. Yes, Effie, my dear; some day
perhaps your verses shall appear with your name to them. Not
while they are so good, though. I only wish they were a little
more masculine.'</p>

<p>Again he lugged out that manuscript, and resumed his copying,
laboriously toiling on. The clock ticked, and the ashes dropped,
and the silence was profound while he performed this intellectual
feat.</p>

<p>At the stroke of noon the servant disturbed him a third time.
He put away his work in the drawer, and went out to meet this
visitor.</p>

<p>This time it was none other than a Lady of Quality&mdash;a Grande
Dame de par le monde. She came in splendid attire, sailing into
the studio like some richly adorned pinnace or royal yacht. A lady
of a certain age, but still comely in the eyes of man.</p>

<p>'Lady Frances!' cried Alec. 'This is, indeed, unexpected.
And you know that it is the greatest honour for me to wait upon
you.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; I know that. But I thought I should like to see
you as you are&mdash;in your own studio. So I came. I hope not at an
inconvenient time.'</p>

<p>'No time could be inconvenient for a visit from you.'</p>

<p>'I don't know. Your model might be sitting to you. To be
sure, you are not a figure-painter. But one always supposes that
models are standing to artists all day long. Good-looking women,
too, I believe. Perhaps you have got one hidden away behind the
screen, just as they do on the stage. I will look.' She put up her
glasses and walked across the room to look behind the screen.
'No: she has gone. Oh! is this your new picture?'</p>

<p>He bowed. 'I hope you like it.'</p>

<p>'I do,' she said, looking at it. 'It seems to me the very best
thing you have done. Oh! it is really beautiful! Do you know,
Mr. Feilding, that you are a very wonderful man?'</p>

<p>Alec laughed pleasantly. Of course he knew. 'If you think
so,' he said.</p>

<p>'You write the most beautiful verses and the most charming
stories: you paint the most wonderful pictures: you belong to
society, and you go everywhere. How do you do it? How do you
find time to do it? I suppose you never want any sleep? Poet,
painter, novelist, journalist! Are you a sculptor as well, by chance?'</p>

<p>'Not yet. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Glutton! Are you a dramatist?'</p>

<p>'Again&mdash;not yet. Perhaps, some time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Insatiate! You are a Master of all the Arts. Alec Feilding,
M.A.' He laughed pleasantly, again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>'You are the cleverest man in all London. Well; I sent you
another story yesterday&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You did. I was about to write and thank you for it. Is it a
true story?'</p>

<p>'Quite true. It happened in my husband's family, thirty years
ago. They are not very proud of it. You can dress it up somehow
with new names.'</p>

<p>'Quite so. I shall rewrite the whole.'</p>

<p>'I don't mind. It is a great pleasure to me to see the stories
in print. And no one suspects poor little Me. Are they so <em>very</em>
badly written?'</p>

<p>'The style is a little&mdash;just a little, may I say?&mdash;jerky. But the
stories are admirable. Do let me have some more, Lady Frances.'</p>

<p>'Remember. No one is to know where you get them.'</p>

<p>'A Masonic secrecy forms part of my character. I even put
my own name to them for greater security.'</p>

<p>He did. Every week he put his own name to stories which he
got from people like this Lady of Quality.</p>

<p>'That ought to disarm suspicion. On the other hand, everybody
must know that you cannot invent these things.'</p>

<p>Alec laughed. 'Most people give me credit for inventing even
your stories.'</p>

<p>'By the way,' she said, 'are you coming to my dinner next
week?'</p>

<p>'With the greatest pleasure.'</p>

<p>'If you don't come you shall have no more stories drawn from
the domestic annals and the early escapades of the British Aristocracy.'</p>

<p>'I assure you, Lady Frances, I look forward with the
greatest&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Very well, then. I shall expect you. And remember&mdash;secrecy.'</p>

<p>She laid her finger on her lips and vanished.</p>

<p>The smile faded out of the young man's face. He sat down
again, and once more set himself to work doggedly copying out the
manuscript, which was, indeed, none other than the story furnished
him by Lady Frances. It was going to appear in the next week's
issue of the journal, with his name at the end.</p>

<p>Was not Alec Feilding the cleverest all-round man in the whole
of London&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnium artium magister</i>?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V_2" id="CHAPTER_V_2"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>ONLY A SIMPLE SERVICE</small></h2>


<p>Mrs. Elstree took the card that the maid brought her. She
started up, mechanically touched her hair&mdash;which was of the
feathery and fluffy kind&mdash;and her dress, with the woman's instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to see that everything was in order: the quick colour rose to her
cheek&mdash;perhaps from the heat of the fire. 'Yes,' she said, 'I am
at home.' She was sitting beside the fire in the drawing-room of
Armorel's flat. It was a cold afternoon in March: outside, a
black east wind raged through the streets; it was no day for driving
or for walking: within, soft carpets, easy-chairs, and bright
fires invited one to stay at home. This lady, indeed, was one of
those who love warmth and physical ease above all other things.
Actually to be warm, lazily warm, without any effort to feel warmth,
afforded her a positive and distinct physical pleasure, just as a cat
is pleased by being stroked. Therefore, though a book lay in her
lap, she had not been reading. It is much pleasanter to lie back
and feel warm, with half-closed eyes, in a peaceful room, than to
be led away by some impetuous novelist into uncomfortable places,
cold places, fatiguing places.</p>

<p>She started, however, and the book fell to the floor, where it
remained. And she rose to her feet when the owner of the card
came in. The relict of Jerome Elstree was still young, and grief
had as yet destroyed none of her beauty. She looked better,
perhaps, in the morning&mdash;which says a great deal.</p>

<p>'Alec?' she murmured&mdash;her eyes as soft as her voice. 'I
thought you would come this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Are you quite alone, Mrs. Elstree?' he asked with a look of
warning.</p>

<p>'Quite, Mr. Feilding. And, since the door is shut, and we are
quite alone&mdash;why&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;' She laughed, held out both her
hands, and put up her face like a child.</p>

<p>He took her hands and bent to kiss her lips.</p>

<p>'Zoe,' he said, 'you grow lovelier every day. Last night&mdash;&mdash;'
He kissed her again.</p>

<p>'Lovelier than Philippa?'</p>

<p>'What is Philippa beside you? An iceberg beside a&mdash;a garden
of flowers&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There is beauty in icebergs, I have read.'</p>

<p>'Never mind Philippa, dear Zoe. She is nothing to us.'</p>

<p>'I don't mind her a bit, Alec, if you don't. If you begin to
mind her&mdash;&mdash; But we will wait until that happens. Why are you
here to-day?'</p>

<p>'I have come to call upon Mrs. Elstree, widow of my poor
friend Jerome Elstree.'</p>

<p>'Ce pauvre Jerome! The tears come into my eyes'&mdash;in fact,
they did at that moment&mdash;'look!&mdash;when I think of him. So often
have I spoken of his virtues and his untimely fate that he has really
lived. I never before understood that there are ghosts of men who
never lived as well as ghosts of the dead.'</p>

<p>'And I came to call upon your charge, Miss Rosevean.'</p>

<p>'Yes'&mdash;she said this dubiously, perhaps jealously&mdash;'so I supposed.
Why did you send me here, Alec? You have always got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
some reason for everything. There was no need for my coming&mdash;I
was doing as well as I expect to do.'</p>

<p>The young man looked about the room without replying to this
question.</p>

<p>'Someone,' he said presently, 'has furnished this room who
knows furniture.'</p>

<p>'It was Armorel herself. I have no taste&mdash;as you know.'</p>

<p>'And how do you get on with her? Are you happy here,
Zoe?'</p>

<p>'I am as happy as I ever expect to be&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' he interrupted, impatiently. 'You like her,
then?'</p>

<p>'I like her as much as I can like any woman. You know,
Alec, I am not greatly in love with my own sex. If there were
no other women in the world than just enough to dress me, get
my dinner, and keep my house clean, I should not murmur. Eve
was the happiest of women, in spite of the difficulties she must
have had in keeping up with the fashion. Because, you see, she
was the only woman.'</p>

<p>'No doubt. And now tell me about this girl.'</p>

<p>'She is rich. To be rich is everything. Money makes an
angel of every woman. When I was eighteen, and first met you,
Alec, I was rich. Then you saw the wings sticking out visibly one
on each shoulder, didn't you? They are gone now&mdash;at least,' she
looked over her shoulder, 'I see them no longer.'</p>

<p>'I heard she was rich. Where did the money come from?'</p>

<p>'It has been saving up for I don't know how long. The girl is
only twenty-one, and she has about thirty thousand pounds,
besides all kinds of precious things worth I don't know how much.'</p>

<p>'Jagenal told me she was comfortably off&mdash;"comfortably," he
said&mdash;but&mdash;thirty thousand pounds!'</p>

<p>'The mere thought of so much makes your eyes glow quite
poetically, Alec. Write a poem on thirty thousand pounds. Well,
that is what she has, and all her own, without any drawbacks: no
nasty poor relations&mdash;no profligate brothers&mdash;to nibble and gnaw.
She has not either brother or sister&mdash;an enviable lot when one has
money. When one has no money a brother&mdash;a successful brother&mdash;might
be useful.'</p>

<p>'And how do you get on with her?'</p>

<p>'I think we do pretty well together. But my post is
precarious.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Because the young woman is pretty, rich, and masterful. It
is a curious thing about women that the most masterful soonest
find their master.'</p>

<p>'You mean that she will marry.'</p>

<p>'If she gets engaged, being rich, she will certainly marry at
once. Until she marries I believe we can get on together, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
she is totally independent of me. This afternoon, for example, she
has gone out to look at pictures somewhere, with a girl she has
picked up somehow&mdash;a girl who writes.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear Zoe, you must look after her. Don't let her
pick up girls and make friendships. You are here to look after
her. I hoped that you would gain her complete confidence&mdash;become
indispensable to her.'</p>

<p>'Oh! that is why you sent me here? Pray, my dear Alec,
what can Armorel be to you?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, dear child,' he replied, patting her soft hand, 'that
will bring any discord between you and me. But&mdash;make yourself
indispensable and necessary to her.'</p>

<p>'You will tell me, I dare say, presently, what you mean. But
you don't know this young islander. Necessary to me she is, as
you know. Necessary to her I shall never become. We have
nothing in common. I can do nothing for her at all, except go out
to theatres and concerts and things in the evening. Even then
our tastes clash. I like to laugh; she likes to sit solemnly with
big eyes staring&mdash;so&mdash;as if she was receiving inspiration. I like
comic operas, she likes serious plays; I like dance music, she likes
classical music; I like the fool's paradise, she likes&mdash;the other
kind, where they all behave so well and are under no illusions. In
fact, Armorel takes herself quite seriously all round. Of course, a
girl with such a fortune can take herself anyhow she pleases.'</p>

<p>'She knows how to dress, apparently. Most advanced girls
disdain dress.'</p>

<p>'But she is not an advanced girl. She is only a girl who knows
a great deal. She is not in the least emancipated. Why, she still
professes the Christian religion. She is just a girl who has set herself
resolutely to learn all she can. She has been about it for five
years. When she began, I understand that she knew nothing.
What she means to do with her knowledge I have not learned.
She talks French and German and Italian. You have heard her
play? Very well: you can't beat that. You shall see some of her
drawings. They are rather in your style, I think. A highly
cultivated girl. That is all.'</p>

<p>'A female prig? A consciously superior person?'</p>

<p>'Not a bit. Rather humble-minded. But masterful and
independent. Where she fails is, of course, in ordinary talk.
She can't talk&mdash;she can only converse. She doesn't know the
pictures and painters, and poets and novelists of the day&mdash;she
doesn't know a single person in society. She doesn't know any
personal history at all. And she doesn't care about any. That is
Armorel.'</p>

<p>'I see,' he replied thoughtfully. 'Things will be difficult, I
am afraid.'</p>

<p>'What things? Oh! there is another point in which she differs
from people of society.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'When you and I, dear Alec, think and talk of people, we conclude
that they are exactly like ourselves&mdash;do we not? Quite
worldly and selfish, you know. Everyone with his little show to
run for himself. Now, Armorel, on the other hand, concludes
that everyone is like&mdash;not us&mdash;but herself. Do you catch the
difference? There is a difference, you know.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes, Zoe, I seem not to understand you. But never
mind. Under your influence&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have no influence at all with her. I never shall have.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear Zoe, why are you here? I want you&mdash;I repeat&mdash;to
exercise an overwhelming influence.'</p>

<p>'Oh! It is impossible. Consider&mdash;you who know me so well&mdash;how
can I influence a girl who is always seeking after great things?
She wants everything noble and lofty and pure. She has what
they call a great soul&mdash;and I&mdash;oh! Alec, you know that I belong
to the infinitely little souls. There are a great, great number of
us, but we are very contemptible.'</p>

<p>'Let us think,' he replied. 'Let us contrive and devise some
way&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Enough about Armorel. Tell me now about yourself.'</p>

<p>'I am always the same.'</p>

<p>'You have come, perhaps, this afternoon,' she murmured softly,
'to bring me some new hope&mdash;Oh! Alec&mdash;at last&mdash;some hope?'</p>

<p>'I have no new hope to give you, child.'</p>

<p>Both sat in silence, looking into the firelight.</p>

<p>'It is seven years&mdash;seven years,' said Zoe, 'since I had my
great quarrel with Philippa. She was eighteen then&mdash;and so was
I&mdash;I charged her with throwing herself at your head, you know.
So she did. So she does still. Why, the woman can't conceal,
even now, that she loves you. I saw it in her eyes last night, I
saw it in her attitude when she was talking to you. She swore
after the row we had that she would never speak to me again.
But you see she has broken that vow. I was eighteen then, and I
was rich, a good deal richer than Philippa ever will be. When
you and I became engaged I was twenty-one. That is four years
ago, Alec. Yet, a year or two, and the girl you were&mdash;engaged
to&mdash;will be thin and faded. For your sake, my dear boy, I hope
that you will not keep her waiting very much longer before you
present her to the world.'</p>

<p>'My dear child, could I help the smash that came&mdash;the smash
and scandal? When the whole town was ringing with your father's
smash and his suicide, and the ruin of I don't know how many
people, was that the moment for us to step forward and take hands
before the world?'</p>

<p>'No; you certainly could not. As a man of the world, you
would have been justified in breaking off the thing&mdash;especially as
it was only a day or two old.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>'I could not let you go, Zoe,' he said, with a touch of real
tenderness. 'I was madly in love.'</p>

<p>'I think you were, Alec. I really think that at the time you
were truly and madly in love. Else you would never have done a
thing of which you repented the next day.'</p>

<p>'I have never repented, dear Zoe&mdash;never once.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you calculated that something would be saved out of
the smash. Perhaps, for once in your life, you never calculated at
all upon anything. Well&mdash;I consented to keep the thing a secret.'</p>

<p>'You know that it was necessary.'</p>

<p>'You said so. I obeyed. But four years&mdash;four years&mdash;and no
prospect of a termination. Consider!' She pleaded as she had
spoken before, in the same soft, caressing, murmuring tone.</p>

<p>'I do consider, Zoe. You can have your freedom again. I
have no right&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nonsense! My freedom? It is your own that you want.
My freedom?' she repeated, but without raising her voice. 'Mine?
What could I do with it&mdash;now? Whither could I turn? Do not,
I advise you, think that I will ever while I live restore your freedom
to you.'</p>

<p>'I spoke in your own interest, believe me.'</p>

<p>'I am now what you have made me. You know what that is.
You know what I was four years ago.'</p>

<p>'I have advised you, it is true.'</p>

<p>'No; you have led me. At the moment of my greatest trouble
you made me break away from my own people, who were sorry for
my misfortunes, and would have kept me among them in my own
circle. There was no reason for me to leave them. The wreck of
my father's fortune was not imputed to me. You persuaded me to
assert my own independence, and to go upon the stage, for which
I was as well fitted as for the kingdom of heaven.'</p>

<p>'I hoped&mdash;I thought&mdash;that you would succeed.'</p>

<p>'No; what you hoped and intended was to keep me in your
power. You would not let me go, and you could not&mdash;or would
not&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Could not, my child. I could not.'</p>

<p>'For four years I have endured the humiliations of the actress
who is a failure and can only take the lowest parts. You know
what I have endured, and yet&mdash;&mdash; Oh! Alec, your love is, indeed,
a noble gift! And now, for your sake, I am here, playing a part
for you. I am the young widow of the man who never existed.
I make up a hundred lies every day to a girl who believes every
word&mdash;which makes it more disgraceful and more horrible. When
one knows that she is disbelieved it is different.'</p>

<p>'Zoe, you know my position.'</p>

<p>'Very well, indeed. You live in a little palace. You keep
your man-servant and your two horses. You go every day into
some kind of good society&mdash;&mdash;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is necessary: my position demands it.'</p>

<p>'Your position, my friend, has nothing to do with it. If you
stayed at home every evening just as many copies of your paper
would be sold. You spend all this money on yourself, Alec,
because you are a selfish person and indulgent, and because you
like to make a great show of success.'</p>

<p>'You do not understand.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I do! You paint lovely pictures, which you sell: you
write admirable stories and excellent verses&mdash;at least, I suppose
they are admirable and excellent. You put them into a paper
which is your own&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes. But all these things leave me as poor as I was four
years ago.'</p>

<p>He got up and stood before the fire, looking into it. Then he
walked across to the window and gazed into the street. Then he
returned and looked into the fire again. This restlessness may be
a sign that something is on a man's mind.</p>

<p>'Zoe,' he said at length, without looking at her, 'your impatience
makes you unjust. You do not understand. Things have
come to a crisis.'</p>

<p>'What kind of a crisis?'</p>

<p>'A financial crisis. I must have money.'</p>

<p>'Then go and make it. Paint more pictures: write more poetry.
Make money, as other men do. It is very noble and grand to pretend
that you only work when you please; but it isn't business,
and it isn't true.'</p>

<p>'Again&mdash;you do not understand. I must have money in a short
time, or else&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Else&mdash;what may happen, Alec?' She leaned forward, losing
her murmuring manner for the first time.</p>

<p>'I may&mdash;I must&mdash;become bankrupt. That to me signifies social
ruin.'</p>

<p>'You have something more to say. Won't you say it at once?'</p>

<p>'If I can get over this difficulty it will be all right&mdash;my anxieties
over. I thought, Zoe, when I sent you here, that, with a girl rich,
mistress of her own, of age, it would be easy for you to wind yourself
into her confidence and borrow&mdash;or beg, or somehow get what
I want out of her. To borrow would be best.'</p>

<p>'How much do you want? Tell me exactly.'</p>

<p>'I want, before the end of next month, about 3,000<i>l.</i> Say,
3,500<i>l.</i>'</p>

<p>'That is a very large sum of money.'</p>

<p>'Not to this girl. Make her lend it to you. Make up some
story. Beg it or borrow it&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;' he laid his hand upon her
shoulder, but she made no movement in reply; he stooped and
kissed her head, but she did not look up. 'Zoe&mdash;I swear&mdash;if you
will do this for me, our long and weary waiting shall be at an end.
I will acknowledge everything. I will give up this extravagant life:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
we will settle down like a couple of honest bourgeois: we will live
over the shop if you like&mdash;that is, the publishing office of the
paper.' He took her hand and raised it to his lips, but she made
no response.</p>

<p>'Would she ever get the money back again?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. How can I tell?'</p>

<p>'Even for the bribe you offer, Alec, I am afraid I cannot do it.'</p>

<p>'We will try together. We will lay ourselves out to attract
the girl, to win her confidence. Consider. She is alone. She is
in our hands&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. But you do not know her. Alec, if I cannot succeed,
what will you do?'</p>

<p>'I must look out for some girl with money and get engaged to
her. The mere fact of an engagement would be enough for me.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said quickly, 'it would have to be. Will you get
engaged to&mdash;to Philippa?'</p>

<p>'No; Philippa will only have money at the death of her father
and mother&mdash;not before. Philippa is out of the question.'</p>

<p>'Is there nobody among all your fine friends who will lend you
the money?'</p>

<p>'No one. We do not lend money to each other. We go
on as if there were no money difficulties in the world, as well
as no diseases, no old age, no dying. We do not speak of money.'</p>

<p>'Friendship in society has its limits. Yes; I see. But can't
you borrow it in the usual way of business people?'</p>

<p>'I should have to show books and enter into unpleasant
explanations. You see, Zoe, the paper has got a very good name,
but rather a small circulation. Everybody sees it, but very few
buy it.'</p>

<p>'And so you heard of Armorel, and you thought that here was
a chance. You say to me, in plain words: "If you get this money,
there shall be an end of the false position." Is that so?'</p>

<p>'That is exactly what I do say and swear, Zoe. It is a very
simple thing. You have only to persuade the girl to lend you this
money, or to advance it, or to invest it by your agency&mdash;or something&mdash;a
very simple and easy thing. You love me well enough to
do me such a simple service.'</p>

<p>'I love you well enough, I suppose,' she replied sadly, 'to do
everything you tell me to do. A simple service! Only to deceive
and plunder this girl, who believes us all to be honourable and
truthful!'</p>

<p>'Oh, we shall find a way&mdash;some way&mdash;to pay her back. Don't
be afraid. And don't go off into platitudes, Zoe&mdash;you are much
too pretty&mdash;and when it is done, and you are openly, before the
world&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know you well enough to know how much happiness to
expect. I am a fool. All women are fools. Philippa is a fool.
And I've set my foolish heart on&mdash;you. If I fail&mdash;if I fail'&mdash;her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
words sank to the softest and gentlest murmur&mdash;'you are going to
cast about for an heiress, and you will get engaged to her, and
then&mdash;then&mdash;we shall see, dear Alec, what will happen then.' She
sat up, her cheek fiery, and her eyes flashing, though her voice
was so soft. 'Hush!' she whispered. 'I hear Armorel's step!'</p>

<p>They heard her voice as well outside, loud and clear.</p>

<p>'Come to my own room,' she said. 'What you want is there.
This way.'</p>

<p>'It is the girl with her&mdash;the girl who writes. They have gone
into her own room&mdash;her boudoir&mdash;her study&mdash;where she works half
the day. The girl lives with her brother, close by.'</p>

<p>They listened, silent, with hushed breath, like conspirators.</p>

<p>'Poor Armorel!' said Zoe. 'If she only knew what we are
plotting! She thinks me the most truthful of women! And all
I am here for is to cheat her out of her money! Don't you think
I had better make a clean breast and ask her to give me the money
and let me go?'</p>

<p>'Begin to-day,' said Alec. 'Begin to talk about me. Interest
her in me. Let her know how great and good&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush!'</p>

<p>Then they heard her voice again in the hall.</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;you must come this evening. Bring Archie with
you. I will play, and he shall listen. You shall both listen. And
then great thoughts will come to you.'</p>

<p>'Always great thoughts&mdash;great thoughts&mdash;great pictures,' Zoe
murmured. 'And we are so infinitely little. Brother worm, shall
we crawl into some hole and hide ourselves?'</p>

<p>Then the door opened, and Armorel herself appeared, fresh and
rosy in spite of the cold wind.</p>

<p>'My dear child,' said Zoe softly, looking up from her cushions,
'come in and sit down. You must be perishing with the east wind.
Do sit down and be comfortable. You met Mr. Feilding last
night, I believe.'</p>

<p>The visitor remained for a quarter of an hour. Armorel had
been to see a certain picture in the National Gallery. He talked of
pictures just as, the night before, he had talked of music: that is to
say, as one who knows all the facts about the painters and their
works and their schools: their merits and their defects. He knew
and could talk fluently the language of the Art Critic, just as he
knew and could talk the language of the Musical Critic. Armorel
listened. Now and then she made a remark. But her manner
lacked the reverence with which most maidens listened to this
thrice-gifted darling of the Muses. She actually seemed not to care
very much what he said.</p>

<p>Zoe, for her part, lay back in her cushions in silence.</p>

<p>'How do you like him?' she asked, when their visitor left them.</p>

<p>'I don't know; I haven't thought about him. He talks too
much, I think. And he talks as if he was teaching.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>'No one has a better right to talk with authority.'</p>

<p>'But we are free to listen or not as we please. Why has he the
right to teach everybody?'</p>

<p>'My dear child, Alec Feilding is the cleverest man in all
London.'</p>

<p>'He must be very clever then. What does he do?'</p>

<p>'He does everything&mdash;poetry, painting, fiction&mdash;everything!'</p>

<p>'Oh, you will show me his poetry, perhaps, some time? And
his pictures I suppose we shall see in May somewhere. He
doesn't look as if he was at all great. But one may be wrong.'</p>

<p>'My dear Armorel, you are a fortunate girl, though you do not
understand your good fortune. Alec&mdash;I am privileged to call him
Alec&mdash;has conceived a great interest in you. Oh, not of the common
love kind, that you despise so much&mdash;nothing to do with your
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux yeux</i>&mdash;but on account of your genius. He was greatly taken
with your playing: if you will show him your pictures he will give
you instruction that may be useful to you. He wants to know
you, my dear.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Armorel, not in the least overwhelmed, 'he can if
he pleases, I suppose, since he is a friend of yours.'</p>

<p>'That is not all: he wants your friendship as a sister in art.
Such a man&mdash;such an offer, Armorel, must not be taken lightly.'</p>

<p>'I am not drawn towards him,' said the girl. 'In fact, I think
I rather dislike his voice, which is domineering; and his manner,
which seems to me self-conscious and rather pompous; and his
eyes, which are too close together. Zoe, if he were not the
cleverest man in London, I should say that he was the most crafty.'</p>

<p>Zoe laughed. 'What man discovers by experiment and experience,'
she murmured, incoherently, 'woman discovers at a
glance. And yet they say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<small>THE OTHER STUDIO</small></h2>


<p>The Failure was at work in his own studio. Not the large and
lofty chamber fitted and furnished as if for Michael Angelo himself,
which served for the Fraud. Not at all. The Failure did
his work in a simple second-floor back, a chamber in a commonplace
lodging-house of Keppel Street, Bloomsbury. Nowhere in the
realms of Art was there a more dismal studio. The walls were
bare, save for one picture which was turned round and showed its
artistic back. The floor had no carpet: there was no other furniture
than a table, strewn and littered with sketches, paints,
palettes, brushes: there were canvases leaning against the wall:
there was a portfolio also leaning against the wall: there was an
easel and the man standing before it: and there was a single chair.</p>

<p>For three years Roland Lee had withdrawn from his former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
haunts and companions. No one knew now where he lived: he
had not exhibited: he had resigned his membership at the club:
he had gone out of sight. Many London men every year go out of
sight. It is quite easy. You have only to leave off going to the
well-known places of resort: very soon&mdash;so soon that it is humiliating
only to think of it&mdash;men cease asking where you are: then
they cease speaking of you: you are clean gone out of their memory&mdash;you
and your works&mdash;it is as if the sea had closed over you.
There is not left a trace or a sign of your existence. Perhaps,
now and then, something may revive your name: some little
adventure may be remembered: some frolic of youth&mdash;for the
rest&mdash;nothing: Silence: Oblivion. It does, indeed, humiliate
those who look on. When such an accident revived the memory
of Roland Lee, one would ask another what had become of him.
And no one knew. But, of course, he had gone down&mdash;down&mdash;down.
When a man disappears it means that he sinks. He had
gone out of sight: therefore he had gone under. Yet, when you
climb, you can never get so high as to be invisible. Even the
President, R.A., is not invisible. Again, the higher that a balloon
soars, the smaller does it grow; but the higher a man climbs up
the Hill of Fame the bigger does he show. It is quite certain that
when a man has disappeared he has sunk. The only question&mdash;and
this can never be answered&mdash;is, what becomes of the men who
sink? One man I heard of&mdash;also, like Roland, an artist&mdash;who has
been traced to a certain tavern, where he fuddles himself every
evening, and where you may treat with him for the purchase of his
pictures at ten shillings&mdash;ay, or even five shillings&mdash;apiece. And
two scholars&mdash;scholars gone under&mdash;I heard of the other day.
They now reside in the same lodging-house. It is close to the
Gray's Inn Road. One lives in the garret, and the other occupies
the cellar. In the evening they get drunk together and dispute on
points of the finer scholarship. But this only accounts for three.
And where are all the rest?</p>

<p>Of Roland Lee nobody knew anything. There was no story or
scandal attached to him: he was no drinker: he was no gambler:
he was no profligate. But he had vanished.</p>

<p>Yet he had not gone far&mdash;only to Keppel Street, which is really
a central place. Here he occupied a second floor, and lived alone.
Nobody ever called upon him: he had no friends. Sometimes he
sat all day long in his studio doing nothing: sometimes he went
forth, and wandered about the streets: in the evening he dined at
restaurants where he was certain to meet none of his old friends.
He lived quite alone. As to that rumour concerning opium, it
was an invention of his employer and proprietor. He did not take
opium. Day after day, however, he grew more moody. What
developments might have followed in this lonely life I know not.
Opium, perhaps: whisky, perhaps: melancholia, perhaps. And
from melancholia&mdash;Good Lord deliver us!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing saved him. The work which filled his soul with rage
also kept his soul from madness. When the spirit of his Art
seized him and held him he forgot everything. He worked as if
he was a free man: he forgot everything, until the time came
when he had to lay down his palette and to come back to the
reality of his life. Some men would have accepted the position:
there were, as we have seen, compensations of a solid and comfortable
kind: had he chosen to work his hardest, these golden
compensations might have run into four figures. Some men
might have sat and laughed among their friends, forgetting the
ignominy of their slavery. Not so Roland. His chains jangled
as he walked; they cut his wrists and galled his ankles: they
filled him with so much shame that he was fain to go away and
hide himself. And in this manner he enjoyed the great success
which his employer had achieved for his pictures. To arrive at
the success for which you have always longed and prayed&mdash;and to
enjoy it in such a fashion. Oh! mockery of fate!</p>

<p>This morning he was at work contentedly&mdash;with ardour. He
was beginning a picture from one of his sketches: it was to be
another study of rocks and sea: as yet there was little to show:
it was growing in his brain, and he was so fully wrapped in
his invention that he did not hear the door open, and was not
conscious that for the first time within three years he had a
visitor.</p>

<p>She opened the door and stood for a moment looking about
her. The bare and dingy walls, the scanty furniture, the meanness
of the place, made her very soul sink within her. For they cried
aloud the story of the painter.</p>

<p>For five long years she had thought of him. He was successful:
he was rising to the top of the tree: he was conquering the
world&mdash;so brave, so strong, so clever! There was no height to
which he could not rise. She should find him splendid, triumphant,
and yet modest&mdash;her old friend the same, but glorified. And she
found him thus, in this dingy den&mdash;so low, so shabby! Consider,
if she had risen while he was sinking, how great was now the gulf
between them! Then she stepped into the room and stood beside
the artist at his easel.</p>

<p>'Roland Lee,' she whispered.</p>

<p>He started, looked up, and recognised her. 'Armorel!' he cried.</p>

<p>Then, strange to say, instead of hastening to meet and greet
her, and to hold out hands of welcome, he stood gazing at her
stupidly, his face changing colour from crimson to white. His hair
was unkempt, she saw; his cheeks worn; his eyes haggard, with
deep lines round them; and his dress was shabby and uncared for.</p>

<p>'You have not forgotten me, then?' she said.</p>

<p>'Forgotten you? No. How could I forget you?'</p>

<p>'Then are you pleased to see me? Shake hands with me,
Roland Lee.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>He complied, but with restraint. 'Have you dropped from the
clouds?' he asked. 'How did you find me here?'</p>

<p>'I met your old friend Dick Stephenson. He told me that
you lived here. You are no longer friends: but he has seen you
going in and coming out. That is how I found you. Are you
well, Roland?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am well.'</p>

<p>'Does all go well with you, my old friend?'</p>

<p>'Why not? You see&mdash;I have got a magnificent studio: there
is every outward sign of wealth and prosperity: and if you look
into any art-criticisms you will find the papers ringing with my
name.'</p>

<p>'You are changed.' Armorel passed over the bitterness of this
speech. 'You are a little older, perhaps.' She did not tell him
how haggard and worn he looked, how unkempt and unhappy.</p>

<p>'Let me see some of your work,' she said. The picture on the
easel was only in its very first stage. She looked about the room.
Nothing on the walls but one picture with its face turned round.
'May I look at this?' She turned it round. It was the picture of
herself, 'The Princess of Lyonesse,' the sketch of which he had
finished on the last day of his holiday. 'Oh!' she cried, 'I
remember this. And you have kept it, Roland&mdash;you have kept it.
I am glad.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I have kept the only picture which I can call my
own.'</p>

<p>'Was I like that in those days?'</p>

<p>'You are like that now. Only, the little Princess has become
a tall Queen.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; I remember. You said, then, that if I should ever
look like this, you would be proved to be a painter indeed. Roland,
you are a painter indeed.'</p>

<p>'No, no,' he said; 'I am nothing&mdash;nothing at all.'</p>

<p>'We were talking&mdash;when you made this sketch&mdash;of how one
can grow to his highest and noblest.'</p>

<p>'I have grown to my lowest,' he replied. 'But you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What has happened, my friend? You told me so much once
about yourself&mdash;you taught me so much&mdash;you put so many new
things into my head&mdash;you must tell me more! What has
happened?'</p>

<p>'Nothing.'</p>

<p>'Why are you here in this poor room? I have been to studios
in Rome and Florence, and Paris and Vienna: they are lovely
rooms, fit for a man whose mind is always full of lovely images
and sweet thoughts. But this&mdash;this room is not a studio. It is an
ugly little prison. How can light and colour visit such a place?'</p>

<p>'It explains itself. It proclaims aloud&mdash;Failure&mdash;Failure&mdash;Failure!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>'This picture is not Failure.'</p>

<p>'My name is unknown. I work on like a mole under ground.
I am a Failure. You have seen Dick Stephenson. What did he
say of me?'</p>

<p>'He said that you must have left off working. But you have
not.'</p>

<p>'What does it matter how much or how long a Failure goes on
working?'</p>

<p>'Have you lost heart, Roland?'</p>

<p>'Heart, and hope, and faith. Everything is lost, Armorel!'</p>

<p>'You have lost your courage because you have failed. But
many men have failed at first&mdash;great men. Robert Browning
failed for years. You were brave once, Roland. You were able
to say that if you knew you were doing good work you cared
nothing for the critics.'</p>

<p>'You see, Dick was right. I no longer do any work. I never
send anything to the exhibitions.'</p>

<p>'But why&mdash;why&mdash;why?'</p>

<p>'Ask me no more questions, Armorel. Go away and leave me.
How beautiful and glorious you have grown, child! But I knew
you would. And I have gone down so low, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, you
see! Yes. I remember how we talked of growing to our full height.
We did not think, you see, of the depths to which we might also
drop. There are awful depths, which you could never guess.'</p>

<p>He sank into the chair, and his head dropped.</p>

<p>Armorel stood over him, the tears gathering into her eyes.</p>

<p>'Roland,' she laid her hand upon his shoulder&mdash;there is no
action more sisterly&mdash;'since I have found you I shall not let you
go again. It is five years since you went away. You will tell me
about yourself, when you please. I have a great deal to tell you.
Don't you remember how sympathetic you used to be in the old
days? I want a great deal more sympathy now, because I am five
years older, and I am trying so much. I want you to hear me
play&mdash;you were the first who ever praised my playing, you know.
And you must see my drawings. I have worked every day, as I
promised you I would. I have remembered all your instructions.
Come and see your pupil's work, my master.'</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>'You live too much alone,' she went on. 'Dick Stephenson
told me that you have given up your club, and that you go nowhere,
and that no one knows how you live. You have dropped quite
away from your old friends. Why did you do that? You live in
this dismal room by yourself&mdash;alone with your thoughts: no
wonder you lose courage and faith.' She opened the portfolio
and drew out a number of the sketches. 'Why,' she said, 'here
are some of those you made with me. Here is Castle Bryher&mdash;you
in the boat, and I on the ledge among the sea-weed under the
great rock&mdash;and the shags in a row on the top: and here is Porth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Cressa&mdash;and here Peninnis&mdash;and here Round Island. Oh! we
have so many things to talk about. Will you come to see me?'</p>

<p>'You had better leave me alone, Armorel,' he said. 'Even you
can do no good to me now.'</p>

<p>'When will you come? See&mdash;I will write down my address.
I have a flat, and it is ever so much better furnished than this, Sir.
Will you come to-night? I shall be at home. There will be no
one but Effie Wilmot. Oh! I am not going to talk about you, but
about myself. I want your praise, Roland, and your sympathy.
Both were so ready&mdash;once. Will you come to-night?'</p>

<p>'You will drive me mad, I think, Armorel!'</p>

<p>'Will you come?'</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'I have got to tell you how I became rich, if you will listen.
You must come and hear my news. Why, there is no one but you
in all London who knew me when I lived on Samson alone with
those old people. You will come to-night, Roland?' Again she
laid her hand upon his shoulder. 'I will ask no questions about
you&mdash;none at all. You will tell me what you please about yourself.
But you must let me talk to you about myself, as frankly as in the
old days. If you have got any kindly memory left of me at all,
Roland, you will come.'</p>

<p>He rose and lifted his shameful eyes to hers, so full of pity and
of tears.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said; 'I will do whatever you tell me.'</p>

<small>A CANDID OPINION</small></h2>


<p>Youth in the London lodging-house! Youth quite poor&mdash;youth
ambitious&mdash;youth with a possible future&mdash;youth meditating great
things! Walk along the streets of Lodging-land&mdash;there are miles
of such streets&mdash;and consider with trembling that the dingy houses
contain thousands of young people&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;who have come
to the city of golden pavements to make&mdash;not a fortune, unless
that happens as well&mdash;but their name. In the long struggle before
the lowest rung of the ladder is reached they endure hardness, but
they complain not. Everything is going to be made up to them
in the splendid time to come.</p>

<p>Something more than a year ago two such young people came
up from the country, and found shelter in a London lodging-house,
where they could work and study until success should arrive. They
were boy and girl, brother and sister&mdash;twins. They had very little
money, and could afford no more than one sitting-room. Therefore,
one worked in the sitting-room and the other in a bedroom,
because their occupations demanded solitude. The one in the
sitting-room was the girl. She was engaged in the pursuit of poetry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
she made verses continually, every day. Unless she was reading
verse, she was either making, or polishing, or devising verses. Of
all pursuits in the world this is at once the most absorbing and the
most delightful. It is also, with the greater part of these who
follow it, the most useless. Thomas the Rhymer sits down and
takes his pen: it is nine of the clock. He considers: he writes:
he scratches out: he writes again: he corrects again: after ten
minutes or so, he looks up. It is three in the afternoon: the
luncheon hour is past: the morning is gone: all he has to show
for the six golden hours, when an account of them is demanded,
will be a single stanza of a ballade. And perhaps not a single editor
will look at it. To Effie Wilmot, the girl-twin, thus engaged morning
after morning, the hours become moments and the days minutes.
The result and outcome of her labours you have already learned. But
she was young, and she lived in hope. A few more weeks, and the
great man, her patron, would have satisfied that whim of wishing to
be thought a poet of society. Strange that one who painted pictures
of such wonderful beauty, who wrote such charming stories in such
endless variety&mdash;stories quaint and bizarre, stories pathetic, stories
humorous&mdash;should so condescend! What could a few simple
verses&mdash;such as hers&mdash;do to increase his fame? However, that
was nearly over. She felt quite happy and light-hearted: as happy
as if, like other poets, she was writing things that would appear
with her own name: she pursued the light and airy fancies of her
brain, capturing one or two, chaining them in the prison of her
rhymes, which, of course, were set to the old-new tunes affected
by the little poets of the day. If they have got no message to
deliver, they can at least come on the stage and repeat over again
the old things clad in dress revived. We can keep on dressing up
in the poet's habit until the poet himself shall come along.</p>

<p>Effie worked on, sitting at the window. Poets can work anywhere,
though, of course, they ought to sit habitually on the sides
of hills, with hanging woods and mountain-streams and waterfalls.
But they can work just as well in a mean London lodging, such
as this where Effie sat, looking out, if she looked through the
curtain, upon a most commonplace street. We can all&mdash;common
spirits as well as poets&mdash;rise above our streets and houses and our
dingy setting&mdash;otherwise there would be no work done at all.
Nay, if we were all cockered up, and daintily surrounded with
things æsthetic and artistic and beautiful, I believe we should be
so happy that nobody would ever do anything. The poet would
murmur his thoughts in indolent rhyme by the fireside: the
musician would drop his fingers among the notes, echoing faintly
and imperfectly the music in his soul&mdash;all for his own enjoyment:
the story-teller would tell his stories to his wife: the dramatist
would make plots without words for his children to act: the
painter would half sketch his visions and leave them unfinished.
Art would die.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>No such temptations were offered to Effie. The æsthetic movement
had not touched that ground-floor front. The shaky round
table stood under the flaring gas which every night made her head
ache; the chiffonier contained in its recesses the tea and sugar and
bread and butter, and, when the money ran to such luxuries, her
jam or her honey or her oranges. There was one easy-chair and
one arm-chair; and before the window a small square table, which
had, at least, the merit of being firm; and at this she wrote.
Everybody knows this kind of room perfectly.</p>

<p>The poetic workshop is always kept locked. No poet ever tells
of the terrific struggles he has to encounter before he finally subdues
his thought and compels it to walk or run in double harness
of rhythm and rhyme. No poet ever confesses how he sometimes
has to let that thought go because he cannot subdue it&mdash;nay, the
same discomfiture has been reported of those who, like M. Jourdain,
speak in prose. And no poet ever shows, as a painter will readily
show us, the first sketch, the first rough draft of a poem, the unfinished
lines, the first feeble attempts at the rhythmic expression
of a great thought. Let us respect the mystery of the craft&mdash;have
we not all dabbled in verse and essayed to play upon the scrannel-pipe?</p>

<p>It was towards noon, however, that Effie was disturbed by the
arrival of a visitor. The event was so unusual&mdash;so unprecedented
even&mdash;that no instructions had ever been given to the lodging-house
servant in the art of introducing callers. She therefore
opened the door, and put in her head&mdash;'A gentleman, Miss'&mdash;and
went downstairs, leaving the gentleman to walk in if he
pleased.</p>

<p>'You, Mr. Feilding?' Effie cried, springing to her feet. 'Oh!
This is, indeed&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The great man took her hand. 'My dear child,' he said, 'I
have been thinking over our conversation of the other day. I am,
of course, only anxious to be of service to you and to your brother,
and so I thought I would call.' He was quite magnificent in his
fur-lined coat, and he was very tall and big, so that he seemed
to fill up the whole room. But he had an unusual air of hesitation.
'I thought,' he repeated, 'that I would call. Yes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The girl sat with her hands in her lap, waiting.</p>

<p>'You remember what I told you about&mdash;the&mdash;the verses which
you sometimes bring me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! Yes. I remember. It is so kind of you, Mr. Feilding,
so very kind and noble&mdash;&mdash;' For the moment the dazzling prospect
of seeing her verses acknowledged as her own in place of seeing
them adopted by the Editor, made her believe that none but a truly
noble person could do such a thing.</p>

<p>'I mean to begin even sooner than I had intended. It is true
that when I took your verses I made them my own by those little
touches and corrections which, as you know very well, distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
true poetry from its imitation'&mdash;It was not until he was gone that
Effie remembered that not a single alteration had ever been made.
So great is the power of the human voice that for the moment she
listened and acquiesced, subdued and ashamed of herself&mdash;'At last,
my young friend, the time for alteration and improvement is past.
You can now stand alone&mdash;your verses signed&mdash;if, of course, we
remain, as I hope, on the same friendly relations.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she murmured.</p>

<p>'Enough. We understand each other. Your brother, you told
me, is at work on a play&mdash;a romantic drama.'</p>

<p>'Yes. He has finished it. He has been at work upon it for
two years, thinking of nothing else all day.'</p>

<p>Mr. Feilding nodded approval.</p>

<p>'That is the way,' he said heartily, 'to produce good work.
Perfect&mdash;absolute&mdash;devotion&mdash;regardless of any earthly consideration.
Art&mdash;Art&mdash;before all else. And now it is done?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he is copying it out.'</p>

<p>'Effie'&mdash;he suddenly changed the subject&mdash;'you have never
told me of your resources. Tell me! I do not ask out of idle
curiosity. That you are not rich I know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, we are not rich. We have a little&mdash;a thousand pounds
apiece&mdash;and we have resolved to live on that, and on what we can
get besides, until we have made our way. We have no rich relations
to help us. My father is a country clergyman with a small
living. We came to town so that Archie could get treatment for
his hip. He is better now, and we shall stay altogether if we can
only hold on.'</p>

<p>'A thousand pounds each. That is seventy pounds a year, I
suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes. But during the last twelve months you have given me
a hundred pounds for my verses&mdash;three pounds for every poem,
and there were thirty-three altogether in the volume&mdash;"Voices and
Echoes," you know.'</p>

<p>The poet who had published these verses did not change colour
or show any sign of emotion in the presence of the poet who had
written them. He nodded his head. 'Yes,' he said, 'on a hundred
and seventy pounds a year you can live&mdash;on seventy you would
starve. Where is your brother?'</p>

<p>'He works in his bedroom. It is the room behind, on the
same floor. My room is upstairs.'</p>

<p>'He requires, I suppose, good food, wine, and certain
luxuries?'</p>

<p>'When we can afford them. Since you took my verses we have
been able to buy things.'</p>

<p>'Your money is well expended. I should like to see your
brother, Effie.'</p>

<p>'I will take you to him,' she said. But she hesitated and
blushed. 'Oh! Mr. Feilding, Archie knows nothing about the&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
volumes, you know! He sees only the verses in the paper.
And he only knows that you have been so kind as to take them.
Don't tell him anything else.'</p>

<p>'Your secret, Effie,' he replied generously, 'is safe with me.
He shall not know it from my lips.'</p>

<p>She thanked him. Again, it was not until he was gone that
Effie remembered that he could not possibly reveal that fact to her
brother.</p>

<p>She led him into the room, at the back of which was her
brother's study and bedroom as well.</p>

<p>Her brother might have been herself, save for a slight manly
growth upon the upper lip, and for the pale cheek of ill health.
The same large forehead overhanging the face, eyes sunken but as
bright as his sister's, the same sensitive lips were his. A finer face
than his sister's, and stronger, but not so sweet. Beside his chair
a pair of crutches proclaimed that he was a cripple. Before him
was a table, at which he was writing. There were on the table,
besides his writing materials, a number of little dolls, some of
which were arranged in groups, while others were lying about
unused. He was copying his finished play: as he copied it he
played the scenes with the dolls and spoke the dialogue. The
dolls were his characters: there was not a single scene or change
of the grouping which this conscientious young dramatist had not
rehearsed over and over again, until every line of the dialogue had
its own stage picture, clear and distinct in his mind.</p>

<p>'You are Mr. Feilding?' he asked, rising with some difficulty.
'I have heard so much of you from Effie. It is a great honour to
have a call from you.'</p>

<p>'I take a deep interest,' the great man replied, 'in anything
that concerns Miss Effie Wilmot. I have been able&mdash;I believe you
know&mdash;to give her some assistance and advice in her work. Oh!'&mdash;he
waved his hand to deprecate any expressions of gratitude&mdash;'I
have done very little&mdash;very little indeed. Now, about yourself.
I learn from your sister that you have ambitions&mdash;you would become
a dramatist?'</p>

<p>'I have no other ambition. It is my only dream.'</p>

<p>'A very good dream indeed. And you have made, I am told,
a start&mdash;a maiden effort&mdash;a preliminary flight to try your wings.
You have written your first attempt at a play?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It is here. It is finished.'</p>

<p>'Tell me, briefly, the plot.'</p>

<p>Some young dramatists mar their plot in getting it out. This
young man had taken the trouble to write out first a rough outline
of his piece and next a complete scenario with every situation
detailed. These he read to his visitor one after the other.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mr. Feilding, when he had finished; 'there is
something in the idea of the play. Perhaps not a completely novel
motif. A good deal might be said as to the arrangement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
scenes. And one or two of the characters might&mdash;but these are
details. Remains to find out how the dialogue goes. Will you
read me a scene or two?'</p>

<p>The dramatist read. As he read he might have observed in the
eyes of his listener a growing eagerness, as of one who vehemently
yearns to get possession of something&mdash;his neighbour's vineyard,
for example, or his solitary ewe lamb. But the reader did not observe
this. He was wholly wrapped in his piece: he threw his
soul into the reading: he was anxious only that his words and his
situations should produce the best effect upon his hearer.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; your dialogue, unhappily, shows the want of skill
common to the beginner,' said Mr. Feilding, when he had finished.
'It will have to be completely rewritten. As it stands now, the play
would be simply killed by it, in spite of the situations, which, with
some alterations, are really pretty good&mdash;pretty good for a first
effort.'</p>

<p>'You don't think, then&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;' the dramatist's voice broke
down. Consider: for two long years he had done nothing but
cast, recast, write, rewrite this play. He had dreamed all this
time of success with this play. And now&mdash;now&mdash;the very first
critic&mdash;and that the most accomplished man of the day&mdash;no less
than Mr. Alec Feilding&mdash;told him that the play would not be
received unless the dialogue was entirely rewritten. He <em>could</em> not
rewrite the dialogue. It was a part of himself. As well ask him
to remake his own face or to reconstruct his legs. His face fell:
his cheeks grew pale: his eyes filled with unmanly tears.</p>

<p>'I am truly sorry, believe me,' said the critic, 'to throw cold
water on your hopes. I have been myself an aspirant. Yet'&mdash;he
hesitated in his kindliness&mdash;'why encourage illusive expectations?
The play as it is&mdash;I say, as it is only&mdash;must be pronounced totally
unfit for the stage. No manager would think of it for a moment.'</p>

<p>'Then I may as well throw it on the fire? And all my work
wasted!'</p>

<p>'Nay&mdash;not wasted. Good work&mdash;true work&mdash;is never wasted.
You ought to have learned much&mdash;very much&mdash;from this two
years' labour. And, as for putting it into the fire'&mdash;he laughed
genially&mdash;'I believe I can show you a better way than that. Look
here, Archie&mdash;I call you by your Christian name because I have so
often talked about you: we are old friends&mdash;I should be really
sorry to think that you had actually lost all your time. Give me
this play: I will take it&mdash;skeleton, scenario, dialogue&mdash;all, just as
it is&mdash;the mere rough, crude, shapeless thing that it is. I will buy
it of you&mdash;useless as it is. I will give you fifty pounds down for it,
and it shall become my property&mdash;my own, absolutely. I shall
then, perhaps, recast and rewrite the play from beginning to end.
When I have made a play out of it worth putting on the stage&mdash;when,
in short, I have made it my own play&mdash;I may possibly
bring it out&mdash;possibly. Most likely, however, not. There's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
chance for you, Archie, such as you will never get again! Fifty
pounds down&mdash;think of that! Fifty pounds!'</p>

<p>The dramatist laid his hand, for reply, upon his papers.</p>

<p>'If it should ever be brought out,' this good Samaritan went on,
'you will come and see it acted. What a splendid lesson it will be
for you in the art of writing drama!'</p>

<p>The dramatist's fingers tightened on his manuscript.</p>

<p>'Of course you must consider your sister,' the considerate
critic continued. 'She has been able to make a few pounds of
late, having been so fortunate as to attract the interest of... one
who is not wholly without influence. Should that interest fail or
be withdrawn you might have&mdash;both of you&mdash;to suffer much privation.
The luxuries which you now enjoy would be impossible&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, you kill me!' cried the unfortunate youth.</p>

<p>'Shall I leave you for the present? My offer is always open&mdash;on
the condition of secrecy&mdash;one is bound to keep business transactions
secret. I will leave you now. There is no hurry. Think
it over carefully and send me an answer.'</p>

<p>He went out and shut the door. The young dramatist, I am
ashamed to say, fell to tears and weeping over the destruction of
his hopes.</p>

<p>'Effie,' said Mr. Feilding, 'I have talked with your brother.
He has read some of the play to me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And you think?' she asked him eagerly.</p>

<p>He shook his head mournfully. 'The boy has much to learn&mdash;very
much. Meantime, the play itself is worthless&mdash;quite worthless.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Poor boy! And he has built so much upon it.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;they all do at the outset. Mind, Effie, he is a clever
boy: he will do. Meantime, he must study.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Poor Archie! Poor boy!'</p>

<p>'It seems hard, doesn't it, not to succeed all at once? Yet
Browning and Tennyson and Thackeray were all well on for forty
before they succeeded. Why should he despair? Meantime I
have made him a little offer.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Mr. Feilding, you are always so good.'</p>

<p>'I have offered to give him fifty pounds&mdash;down&mdash;and to take
this rough unlicked thing he calls a Play. If I find time I shall,
perhaps, rewrite the whole, and put it on the stage. It will then,
of course, be my own&mdash;my own, Effie. Good-bye, child. I have
not forgotten our talk&mdash;or my promise&mdash;if we remain on friendly
relations.'</p>

<p>He went away. Effie sank into a chair. What she had done
with her own work had never seemed to her half so terrible as what
was now proposed to be done with her brother's work.</p>

<p>She crept into his room. He sat with his head in his hands,
most mournful of bards since the world began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>'Archie, I know&mdash;I know; he has told me. Oh! Archie&mdash;do
you think it is true?'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/i_175.jpg" width="369" height="600" alt="&#39;Archie, I know&mdash;I know.&#39;" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>&#39;Archie, I know&mdash;I know.&#39;</i></span>
</div>

<p>'He says so, Effie. He says it is worthless.'</p>

<p>'Yet he will give you fifty pounds.'</p>

<p>'That is to please you&mdash;for your sake. The thing is worthless&mdash;no
manager would look at it.'</p>

<p>'Yet&mdash;fifty pounds! Why should Mr. Feilding give fifty pounds&mdash;a
whole fifty pounds&mdash;for a worthless play? Archie, don't do it&mdash;don't
let him have it; wait a little&mdash;we will ask somebody else.
Oh! I could tell you something. Wait&mdash;tell him, if you must say
anything, that you will think it over.'</p>

<p>When Effie turned over the pages of the next number of <i>The
Muses Nine</i>, she found, first of all, her own verses in the Editor's
column with his name at the bottom. This sight, which had
formerly made her so proud, now filled her with shame. The
generous promise of the future failed to awaken in her any glow
of hope. For the very words with which her only editor had
beguiled her of her verses&mdash;the plea that they were worthless, and
must be rewritten&mdash;he had used to her brother. And as her
poems had never been rewritten, so would Archie's play, she felt
sure, be presented without a single alteration, with the name of
Mr. Alec Feilding as author. That week she took no verses to the
studio-study.</p>

<p>And a certain paragraph in the same columns perused by this
suspicious young woman brought rage&mdash;nothing short of rage&mdash;into
her heart. No! not her brother, as well as herself! It ran
thus: 'I have always been under the impression that the dearth
of good plays is due to nothing else in the world than the fact that
the good men who ought to be writing them all run off into the
domain of fiction. It is a pleasant country&mdash;that of Fable Land.
I have been there, and I hope to go there again and make a long
stay. But Play Land&mdash;that is also a pleasant country. I have
been there lately, and I hope to demonstrate that a good play may
still be produced in the English tongue&mdash;a good and original play.
In short, I have written a romantic drama, of which all I can say
at present is that it lies finished, in my fireproof safe, and that a
certain actor-manager will probably play the title-rôle before many
moons have waxed and waned.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Effie, crumpling up the paper. 'You have not got
Archie's romantic drama yet.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII_2" id="CHAPTER_VIII_2"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>ALL ABOUT MYSELF</small></h2>


<p>'You have kept this promise, then.' Armorel welcomed her old
friend with eyes of kindness and lips of smiles. 'Do you ever
think of the promise that you broke? Effie, dear'&mdash;this young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
lady was the only other occupant of the room&mdash;'this is Mr. Roland
Lee&mdash;my first friend and my first master. He knew me long ago,
in Samson, in the days of which I have told you. We have
memories of our own&mdash;memories such as make the old friendships
impossible to be dissolved&mdash;whatever happens. Roland, you first
put a pencil into my hand and taught me how to use it. In return,
I used to play old-fashioned tunes in the evening. And you first
put thoughts into my head. Before you came my head was filled
with phantoms, which had neither voice nor shape. What am I
to do now in return for such a gift?' She gave him both her
hands, and her face was so glowing, her eyes so soft yet serious
withal, her voice so full of tenderness&mdash;that the luckless painter
stood confused and overwhelmed. How had he deserved such a
reception?</p>

<p>'This evening,' she went on, 'we are going to talk about
nobody but myself, and about nothing but my own affairs. Effie,
you will be horribly bored. It is five years since I had such a
chance. Because, my dear, though you have the best will in the
world, and would talk to me about old times if you could, you did
not know me when I lived on Samson in the Scilly Islands&mdash;and
Roland did. That is, if he still remembers Samson.'</p>

<p>'I remember every day on Samson: every blade of grass on the
island: every boulder and every crag.'</p>

<p>'And every talk we had in those days?&mdash;all the things you
told me?'</p>

<p>'I remember, as well, a girl who has so changed, so grown&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'So much the better. Then we can talk just as we used to do.
I thought you would somehow remember the girl, Roland.' She
looked up again, smiling. Then she hesitated, and went on
slowly: 'Yet I was afraid, this morning, that you might have
forgotten one of the two who wandered about the island together.'</p>

<p>'I could never forget you, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'I meant&mdash;the other&mdash;Roland.'</p>

<p>He made no reply. In his evening dress&mdash;which was full of
creases, as if it had not been put on for a very long time&mdash;he
looked a little less forlorn than in the shabby old brown-velvet
jacket; he had brushed his hair&mdash;nay, he had even had it cut and
trimmed: but there still hung about him the look of waste: his
eyes were melancholy: his bearing was dejected: he spoke with
hesitation: he was even shy, like a schoolboy. Effie noted these
things, and wondered. And she observed, besides, not only that
his coat was creased, but that his shirt was frayed at the cuffs, and
torn in the front. In fact, the young man, in dropping out of
society, had, as a natural consequence, neglected his wardrobe and
allowed his linen to run to seed unrebuked. Every man who has
been a bachelor&mdash;most of us have&mdash;remembers how shirts behave
when the eye of the master is once taken off them.</p>

<p>He was shy because the atmosphere of the drawing-room, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
dainty, so luxurious, so womanly, was strange to him. Three
years and more had passed since he had been in such a room. He
was also shy because this splendid creature, this girl dressed in silk
and lovely lace, this miracle of girls, called herself Armorel, his
once simple rustic maid of Samson Isle. Further, he was ashamed
because this girl remembered him as he was in the good old days,
when his face was turned to the summit of the mountain and his
feet were on the upward slope.</p>

<p>Armorel had placed on the table a portfolio full of drawings.</p>

<p>'Now for myself,' she said, gaily. 'Roland, you are an artist.
You must look at my drawings. Here are the best I have done.
I have had many masters since you, but none that taught me so
much in so short a time. Do you remember when you first found
out that I could hold a pencil? You were very patient then,
Master. Be lenient now.'</p>

<p>'I had a very apt pupil,' he began, turning over the drawings.
'These need no leniency. These are very good indeed. You have
had other and better masters.'</p>

<p>'I have had other masters, it is true. I have done my best,
Roland&mdash;to grow.'</p>

<p>He dropped his eyes. But he continued to turn over the
sketches. The drawings showed, at least, that natural aptitude
which may be genius and may be that imitation of genius which is
difficult to distinguish from the real gift. Many painters with no
more natural aptitude than Armorel have risen to be Royal
Academicians.</p>

<p>'But these are very good indeed,' Roland repeated, with
emphasis. 'You have, indeed, worked well, and you have the
true feeling.'</p>

<p>'Do you remember, Roland, that day when we talked about
the Perfect Woman? No, I see by your eyes that you have forgotten.
But I remember. I will not tell you all. One thing she
had done: she had trained her eye and her hand. She knew what
was good in Art, and was not carried away by any follies or
fashions. I did not understand then what you meant by follies
and fashions. But I am wiser now. I have been training eye and
hand. I think I know a good picture, or a good statue, or a good
work in any Art. Do not think me conceited, Master. I have
been obedient to your instructions&mdash;that is all.'</p>

<p>'You have the soul of an artist, Armorel,' said her Master.
'But yet&mdash;I fear&mdash;I think&mdash;you have missed the supreme gift.
You are not a great artist.'</p>

<p>'No, I can grow no higher in painting. I have learned my
own limitations. If it is only to understand and to worship the
Great Masters it is worth while to get so far. Are you satisfied
with your pupil?'</p>

<p>For a moment the old look came back to Roland's eyes. 'You
are the best of pupils,' he said. 'But I might have expected so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
much. Tell me how you succeeded in getting away from
Samson?'</p>

<p>She told him, briefly, how the Ancient Lady died, how she
found the family treasure, and how she had resolved to go away
and learn: how she found masters and guardians: how she lived
in Florence, Dresden, Paris: how she worked unceasingly. 'I
remembered, always, Roland, your picture of the Perfect Woman.'</p>

<p>'Could I&mdash;I&mdash;have told you things that have made you&mdash;what
you are?' It seemed as if another man had given the girl this
excellent advice. Not himself&mdash;quite another man.</p>

<p>'Effie, dear,' Armorel turned to her, 'you do not understand.
I must tell you. Five years ago, when I lived on Samson, a girl
so ignorant that it makes me tremble to think what might have
happened&mdash;there came to the island a young gentleman who was so
kind as to take this ignorant girl&mdash;me&mdash;in hand, and to fill her
empty head with all kinds of great and noble thoughts. He was
an artist by profession. Oh! an artist filled with ardour and with
ambition. He would be satisfied with nothing short of the best:
he taught me that none of us ought to be satisfied till we have
attained our full stature, and grown as tall as we possibly can. It
made that ignorant girl's heart glow only to hear him talk, because
she had never heard such talk before. Then he left her, and came
back no more. But presently the chance came to this girl, as you
have heard, and she was able to leave the island and go where she
could find masters and teachers. It is five years ago. And always,
every day, Roland'&mdash;her lip quivered&mdash;'I have said to myself,
"My first master is growing taller&mdash;taller&mdash;taller&mdash;every day&mdash;I
must grow as tall as I can, or else when I meet him again I shall
be too insignificant for him to notice." Always I have thought
how I should meet him again. So tall, so great, so wonderful!'</p>

<p>Effie remarked that while Armorel addressed Roland she did
not look at him until the last words, when she turned and faced
him with eyes running over. The man's head dropped: his fingers
played with the drawings: he made no reply.</p>

<p>'In the evening,' Armorel went on, 'we used to have music.
I played only the old-fashioned tunes then that Justinian Tryeth
taught me&mdash;do you remember the tunes, Roland? I will play one
for you again.' She took a violin out of the case and began to tune
the strings. 'This is my old fiddle. It has been Justinian's&mdash;and
his father's before him. I have had other instruments since
then, but I love the old fiddle best.' She drew her bow across the
strings. 'I can play much better now, Roland. And I have much
better music; but I will play only the old tunes, because I want
you to remember quite clearly those two who walked and talked
and sailed together. It is so easy for you to forget that young man.
But I remember him very well indeed.' She drew the bow across
the strings again. 'Now we are in the old room, while the old
people are sitting round the fire. Effie, dear, put the shade over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the lamp and turn it low&mdash;so&mdash;now we are all sitting in the firelight,
just as it used to be on Samson&mdash;see the red light dancing
about the walls. It fills your eyes and makes them glow, Roland.
Oh! we are back again. What are you thinking of, artist, while
the music falls upon your ears?&mdash;while I play&mdash;what shall I play?
"Dissembling Love," which others call "The Lost Heart"?' She
played it with the old spirit, but far more than the old delicacy and
feeling. 'You remember that, Roland? Do you hear the lapping
of the waves in Porth Bay and the breakers over Shark Point? Or
is it too rustic a ditty? I will play you something better, but still
the old tunes.' She played first 'Prince Rupert's March,' and then
'The Saraband'&mdash;great and lofty airs to one who can play them
greatly. While she played Effie watched. In Armorel's eyes she
read a purpose. This was no mere play. The man she called her
master listened, sitting at the table, the sketches spread out before
him, ill at ease, and as one in a troubled dream.</p>

<p>'Do you see him again, that young man?' Armorel asked.
'It makes one happy only to think of such a young man. He
knew the dangers before him. "The Way of Wealth," he said
once, "and the Way of Pleasure draw men as if with ropes." But
he was so strong and steadfast. Nothing would turn him from his
way. Not Pleasure, not Wealth, not anything mean or low. There
was never any young man so noble. Oh! Do you remember him,
Roland? Tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;do you remember him?'</p>

<p>Over the pictures on the table he bowed his head. But he
made no reply. Then Effie, watching the glittering tears in
Armorel's eyes and the bowed head of the man, stole softly out of
the room and closed the door.</p>

<p>Armorel put down her fiddle. She drew nearer to the man.
His head sank lower. She stood over him, tall and queenly, as the
Muse stood over Alfred de Musset. She laid her hand upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>'That old spirit is not dead, but sleeping, Roland. You have
not driven it forth. It is your own still. You have only silenced
its voice for a while. You think that you have killed it; but you
remember it still. Thank God! it has been only sleeping. If it
were dead you would not remember. Let it wake again. Oh!
Roland&mdash;let it wake again&mdash;again. Oh! Roland&mdash;Roland&mdash;my
friend and Master&mdash;&mdash;' She could say no more.</p>

<p>The man raised his head. It is a shameful and a terrible thing
to see the face of a man who is disgraced and conscious of his
shame. Perhaps it is worse to see the face of a man who is disgraced
and is unconscious of his shame. He looked round, and
saw the tears in the girl's eyes and the quivering of her lips.</p>

<p>'The man you remember,' he said hoarsely, 'is dead and buried.
He died three years ago and more. Another man&mdash;a poor and
mean creature&mdash;walks about in his shape. He is unworthy to be
in your presence. Suffer him to go, and think of him no longer.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>'Not another man, because you remember the former. Roland,
come back, my old friend; come back!'</p>

<p>'It is too late.' But he wavered.</p>

<p>'It is never too late. Oh! I wonder&mdash;was it the Way of
Pleasure or was it the Way of Wealth?'</p>

<p>'Do I look,' he asked bitterly, 'as if it was the Way of
Pleasure?'</p>

<p>'It is not too late, Roland. You have sinned against yourself.
If it were too late you would be happy after the kind of those who
can live in sin and be happy. Since you are not happy, it is not
too late. The doors of heaven stand open night and day for all.'</p>

<p>'You talk the old language, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'It is the language of my soul. I will say the same thing in
any tongue you please, so that you understand me.'</p>

<p>'To go back&mdash;to begin all over again&mdash;to go on as if the last
three years had never been&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;as if they had never been! That is best. As if
they had never been.'</p>

<p>'Armorel, do you know,' he asked her quickly&mdash;'do you know
the thing&mdash;the Awful Thing&mdash;that I have done?'</p>

<p>'Do not tell me. Never tell me.'</p>

<p>'Some day, I think I must. What shall I say, now?'</p>

<p>'Say that your footsteps are turned in the old way, Roland.'</p>

<p>He pushed back the chair and stood up. Now, if they had
been measured, he would have proved four inches and a half taller
than the girl, for he was half an inch short of six feet, and she
was exactly five feet seven. Yet as they stood face to face, it
seemed to him&mdash;and to her as well&mdash;as if she towered over him by
as many inches as separate the tallest woman from the smallest
man. Nature thus accommodates herself to the mental condition
of the moment.</p>

<p>The small man, however, did a very strange thing. He drew
forth a pocket-book and took from it what Armorel perceived to be
a cheque. This he deliberately tore across twice, and threw the
fragments into the fire.</p>

<p>'You do not understand this act, Armorel. It is the turning
of the footstep.'</p>

<p>She took his hand and pressed it. 'I pray,' she said, 'that
the way may prove less thorny than you think!'</p>

<p>Nature, again accommodating herself, caused the small, mean
man to grow suddenly several inches. There was still a goodly
difference between the two, but it was lessened. More than that,
the man continued to grow; and his face was brighter, and his
eyes less haggard.</p>

<p>'I will go now, Armorel,' he said.</p>

<p>'You will come again&mdash;soon?'</p>

<p>'Not yet. I will come again, when the shame of the present
belongs to the past.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>'No. You shall come often. But of past or present we will
speak no more. Tell me, in your own good time, Roland, how
you fare. But do not desert your old pupil. Come to see me
often.'</p>

<p>He bowed his head and went away.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'Effie,' said Armorel, presently, 'I cannot tell you what all
this means.'</p>

<p>'It means a man who has fallen,' said the girl, wise with
poetic instinct. 'Anyone could see failure and shame written on
his face. It ought to be a noble face, but something has gone
out of it. You knew him long ago&mdash;when he was different&mdash;and
you tried to bring him to his old self. Oh! Armorel&mdash;you are
wonderful&mdash;you were his better spirit&mdash;you were his muse&mdash;calling
him back.'</p>

<p>She laid her hand in Armorel's. They stood together in
silence. Then Armorel spoke.</p>

<p>'I feared it was quite another man&mdash;a new man&mdash;a stranger
that I had found. But it was not. It was the same man after
all.'</p>

<p>Effie stooped and picked up a fragment of paper lying on the
hearth. 'Mr. Feilding's signature,' she said, unthinking. At
times, when one is moved, trifles sometimes seem to acquire importance.</p>

<p>'That? It is a part of a cheque which he tore up. Effie,
dear&mdash;it was good of you to go away and leave us when you did.
Perhaps he would not have spoken so freely if you had been here.
Oh! he is the same man, after all. He has come back to me. Effie,
tell me; but you know no more than I. If you once loved a man,
and if you suffered the thought of him to lie in your heart for years,
and if you filled him with all the virtues that there are, and if he
grew in your heart to be a knight perfect at all points&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, Armorel?' For she stopped, and Effie took her hand.</p>

<p>'Oh! Effie,' she replied, with glowing cheeks; 'could you ever
afterwards love another man? Could you ever cease to love that
man of your imagination? Could any meaner man content you?
For my part&mdash;never!&mdash;never!&mdash;never!'</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX_2" id="CHAPTER_IX_2"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>TO MAKE HIM HAPPY</small></h2>


<p>'Shall we discuss Mr. Feilding any longer?' Armorel asked, with
a little impatience. 'It really seems as if we had nothing to talk
about but the perfections of this incomparable person.' It was in
the evening. Armorel had discovered, already, that the evenings
spent at home in the society of her companion were both long and
dull; that they had nothing to talk about; that Zoe regarded every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
single subject from a point of view which was not her own; and
that both in conversation and in personal intercourse she was
having a great deal more than she desired of Mr. Alec Feilding.
Therefore, she was naturally a little impatient. One cannot every
evening go and sit alone in the study: one cannot play the violin
all the evening: and one cannot reduce a companion to absolute
silence.</p>

<p>Zoe, who had been talking into the fire from her cushions,
turned her fluffy head, opened her blue eyes wide, and looked, not
reproachfully but sorrowfully and with wonder, at a girl who could
hear too much about Alec Feilding.</p>

<p>'Let me talk&mdash;just a little&mdash;sometimes&mdash;of my best friend,
Armorel, dear. If you only knew what Alec has been to me and
to my lost lover&mdash;my Jerome!'</p>

<p>'Forgive me, Zoe. Go on talking about him.'</p>

<p>'How quiet and cosy,' she murmured, in reply, 'this room is
in the evening! It makes one feel virtuous only to think of the
cold wind and the cold people outside. This heaven is surely a
reward for the righteous. It is enough only to lie in the warmth
without talking. But the time and the place invite confidences.
Armorel, I am going to repose a great confidence in you&mdash;a secret
plan of my own. And you are so very, very sympathetic when you
please, dear child&mdash;especially when Effie is here&mdash;I wonder if she
is worth it?&mdash;that you might spare me a little of your sympathy.'</p>

<p>'My dear Zoe'&mdash;Armorel felt a touch of remorse&mdash;she had been
unsympathetic&mdash;'you shall have all there is to spare. But what
kind of sympathy do you want? You were talking of Mr. Feilding&mdash;not
of yourself.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;and that is of myself in a way. I know you will not misunderstand
me, dear. You will not imagine that I am&mdash;well, in
love with Alec, when I confess to you that I think a very great
deal about him.'</p>

<p>'I never thought so, at all,' said Armorel.</p>

<p>Zoe's eyes opened for a moment and gleamed. It was a doubtful
saying. Why should not she be in love with Alec, or Alec with
her? But Armorel knew nothing about love.</p>

<p>'When a woman has loved once, dear,' she murmured, 'her
heart is gone. My love-passages,' she put her handkerchief to her
eyes&mdash;to some women the drawing-room is the stage&mdash;'my love-story,
dear, is finished and done. My heart is in the grave with
Jerome. But this you cannot understand. I think so much of
Alec&mdash;first, because he has been all goodness to me; and, next,
because he is so wonderfully clever.'</p>

<p>'Talk about him, Zoe, as long as you please.'</p>

<p>'If he had been an ordinary man,' she went on, 'I should have
been equally grateful, I suppose. But there it would have ended.
To be under a debt of gratitude to such a man as Alec makes one
long to do something in return. And, besides, there are so very,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
very few good men in the world that it does one good only to talk
about them.'</p>

<p>'I suppose that Mr. Feilding is really a man of great genius,'
said Armorel. 'I confess he seems to me rather ponderous in his
talk&mdash;may I say, dull? From genius one expects the unexpected.'</p>

<p>'Dull? Oh, no! A little constrained in his manner. That
comes from his excessive sensibility. But dull?&mdash;oh, no!'</p>

<p>'He seemed dull at the theatre last night.'</p>

<p>'It was a curious coincidence meeting him there, was it not?'</p>

<p>'I thought you must have told him that you were going.'</p>

<p>'No, no; quite a coincidence. And he so seldom goes to a
theatre. The badness of the acting, he says, irritates his nerves to
such a degree that it sometimes spoils his work for a week. And
yet he is actually going to bring out a play himself. There is a
paragraph in the paper about it&mdash;his own paper. Give it to me,
dear; it is on the sofa. Thank you.' She read the paragraph,
which we already know. 'What do you think of that, Armorel?'</p>

<p>'Isn't it rather arrogant&mdash;about good men turning out good
work?'</p>

<p>'My dear, genius can afford to be arrogant. True genius is
always impatient of small people and of stupidities. It suffers its
contempt to be seen, and that makes the stupidities cry out about
arrogance. Even the most stupid can cry out, you see. But think.
He is going to add a new wreath to his brow. He is already known
as a poet, a novelist, a painter, an essayist, and now he is to become
a dramatist. He really is the cleverest man in the whole world.'</p>

<p>Armorel expressed none of the admiration that was expected.
She was wondering whether, if Mr. Feilding had not been quite so
clever, he might not have been quite so heavy and didactic in conversation.
Less clever people, perhaps, are more prodigal of their
cleverness, and give away some of it in conversation. Perhaps the
very clever want it all for their books.</p>

<p>'I said I would give you his poems,' Zoe continued. 'I bought
the book for you&mdash;the second series, which is better than the first.
It is on the piano, dear; that little parcel, thank you.' She
opened the parcel and disclosed a dainty little volume in white
and gold. It was illustrated by a small etching of the poet's
head for a frontispiece. It was printed in beautiful new type
on thick paper&mdash;the kind called hand-made&mdash;the edges left ragged.
There were about a hundred and twenty pages, and on every two
pages there was a single poem. These were not arranged in any
order or sequence of thought. They were all separate. The poet
showed knowledge of contemporary manners in serving up so small
a dish of verse. Fifty or sixty short poems is quite as much as the
reader of poetry will stand in these days.</p>

<p>Armorel turned over the pages and began to read them.
Strange! How could a man so ponderous, so pompous in his
conceit, so dogmatic, so self-conscious, write such pretty, easy-flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
numbers? The metres fitted the subject; the rhymes
were apt, the cadence true, the verses tripped light and graceful
like a maiden dancing.</p>

<p>'How could such a man,' she cried, 'get a touch so light? It
is truly wonderful.'</p>

<p>'I told you so, dear. He is altogether wonderful.'</p>

<p>She went on reading. Presently she cried out, 'Why! he
writes like a woman. Only a woman could have written these
lines.' She read them out. 'It is a woman's hand, and a woman's
way of thinking.'</p>

<p>'That shows his genius. No one except Alec&mdash;or a woman&mdash;could
have said just that thing in just that manner.'</p>

<p>Armorel closed the volume. 'I think,' she said, 'that I like a
man to write like a man and a woman like a woman.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Zoe, 'how is a novelist to make a woman talk?'</p>

<p>'He makes his women talk like women if he can. But when
he speaks himself it must be with the voice of a man. In these
poems it is the poet who speaks, not any character, man or
woman.'</p>

<p>'You will like the poems better as you read them. They will
grow upon you. And you will find the poet himself&mdash;not a woman,
but a man&mdash;in his verses. It helps one so much to understand the
verses when you know the poet. I think I could almost understand
Browning if I had ever known him. Think of Alec when you
read his verses.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Armorel, still without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'You said we were talking about nothing else, dear,' Zoe went
on. 'I talk so much of him because I respect and revere him so
much. I have known Alec a long time'&mdash;she lay back with her
head turned from her companion, talking softly into the fire, as if
she was communing with herself. 'He is, though you do not
understand it yet, a man of the most highly strung and sensitive
nature. The true reason why he talks ponderously&mdash;as you call
it, Armorel&mdash;is that he is conscious of the traps into which this
very sensitiveness of his may lead him: for instance, he may say,
before persons unworthy of his confidence, things which they
would most likely misunderstand. It is simply wicked to cast
pearls before swine. A poet, more than any other man, must be
quite sure of his audience before he gives himself away. I assure
you, when Alec feels himself alone with his intimates&mdash;a very little
circle&mdash;his talk is brilliant.'</p>

<p>'We are unlucky, then,' said Armorel, still without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'Another thing may make him seem dull. He is always preoccupied,
always thinking about his work: his mind is overcharged.'</p>

<p>'I thought he was always in society&mdash;a great diner-out?'</p>

<p>'He is. Society brings him relief. The inanities of social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
intercourse rest his brain. Without this rest he would be
crushed.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Armorel, coldly.</p>

<p>'Then there is that other side of him&mdash;of which you know
nothing. My dear, he is constantly thinking of others. His
private life&mdash;but I must not tell too much. Not only the cleverest
man in London, but the best.'</p>

<p>Armorel felt guilty. She had not, hitherto, looked upon this
ph&oelig;nix with the reverence which was due to so great a creature.
Nay, she did not like him. She was repelled rather than attracted
by him. She liked him less every time she met him. And this was
oftener than she desired. Somehow or other, they were always
meeting. On some pretext or other he was always calling. And
certainly for the last few days Zoe was unable to talk about
anything else. The genius, the greatness of this man seemed to
overwhelm her.</p>

<p>'And now, my dear,' she went on, still talking about him, 'for
my little confidences. I have a great scheme in my head. Oh! a
very great scheme indeed.' She turned round and sat up, looking
Armorel full in the face. Her eyes under her fluffy hair were
large and luminous, when she lifted them. Oftener, they were
large but sleepy eyes. Now they were quite bright. She was
wide awake and she was in earnest. 'I have spoken to no one
but you about it as yet. Perhaps you and I can manage it all by
ourselves.'</p>

<p>'What is it?'</p>

<p>'You and I, dear, you and I, we two&mdash;we can be so associated
and bound up in the life of the poet-painter as to be for ever
joined with his name. Petrarch and Laura are not more closely
connected than we may be with Alec Feilding, if you only join
with me.'</p>

<p>'First tell me what it is&mdash;this plan of yours.'</p>

<p>'It is nothing less than just to relieve him, once for all, from
his business cares.'</p>

<p>'Has he business cares?'</p>

<p>'They take up his precious time. They weigh upon his mind.
Why should such a man have any business at all to look after?'</p>

<p>'Well, but,' said Armorel, refusing to rise to this tempting
bait, 'why does such a man allow himself to have business cares,
if they worry him?'</p>

<p>'It is the conduct of his journal, my dear.'</p>

<p>'But other authors and painters do not conduct journals. Why
should he? I believe that successful writers and artists make very
large incomes. If he is so successful, why does he trouble about
managing a paper? That is certainly work that can be done by a
man of inferior brain.'</p>

<p>'You are so matter-of-fact, dear. The paper is his own, and
he thinks, I suppose, that nobody but himself could edit the thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Leave poor Alec one or two human weaknesses. He may think
this, and yet make no allowance for his own shrinking and sensitive
nature.'</p>

<p>Certainly Armorel had seen no indications in this poet-painter
of the shrinking nature. It was very carefully concealed.</p>

<p>'Of course,' Zoe continued, 'you hardly know him. But his
genius you do know. And the business worries that are inseparable
from a journal are a serious hindrance to his higher work.
Believe me, dear, even if you do not understand why it should be
so.'</p>

<p>'I can very well believe it&mdash;I only ask why Mr. Feilding alone,
among authors and painters, should hamper himself with such
worries.'</p>

<p>'Well, dear&mdash;there they are. And I have formed a plan&mdash;Oh!'&mdash;she
clasped her hands and opened her eyes wide&mdash;'such a
plan! The best and the cleverest plan in the world for the best
and the cleverest man in the world! But I want your help.'</p>

<p>'What can I do?'</p>

<p>'I will tell you. First of all. You must remember that Alec
is the sole proprietor, as well as the editor of this journal&mdash;<i>The
Muses Nine</i>. It is his property. He created it. But the business
management of the paper worries him. My plan, Armorel&mdash;my
plan'&mdash;she spoke and looked most impressive&mdash;'will relieve him
altogether of the work.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;and how do I come into your plan?'</p>

<p>'This way. I have found out, through a person of business,
that if he would sell a share&mdash;say a quarter, or an eighth&mdash;of his
paper he would be able to put the business part of it into paid
hands&mdash;the people who do nothing else. Now, Armorel, we will
buy that share&mdash;you and I between us will buy it. You shall
advance the whole of the money, and I will pay you back half.
The price will be nothing to you. That is, it will be a great deal,
because the investment will be such a splendid thing, and the
returns will be so brilliant. You will increase your income
enormously, and you will have the satisfaction'&mdash;she paused,
because, though she was herself more animated, earnest, and
eloquent with voice and eyes, and though she threw so much persuasion
into her manner, the tell-tale face of the girl showed no
kindling light of response at all&mdash;'the satisfaction,' she continued,
'of feeling that such a help to Literature and Art will make us both
immortal.'</p>

<p>Armorel made no reply. She was considering the proposition
coldly, and it was one of those things which must be considered
without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'As for money,' Zoe continued, with one more attempt to
awaken a responsive fire, 'I have found out what will be wanted.
For three thousand five hundred pounds we can get this share in
the paper. Only three thousand five hundred pounds! That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
no more than one thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds apiece!
I shall insist upon having my share in the investment, because I
should grudge you the whole of the work. As for the returns, I
have been well advised of that. Of course, Alec is beyond all
paltry desire for gain, and he might ask a great deal more. But
he leaves everything to his advisers&mdash;and oh! my dear, he must
on no account know&mdash;yet&mdash;who is doing this for him. Afterwards,
we will break it to him gradually, perhaps, when he has quite recovered
from the worries and is rested. If we think of returns,
ten, twenty, even fifty per cent. may be expected as the paper gets
on. Think of fifty per cent.!'</p>

<p>'No,' said Armorel. 'Let us, too, be above paltry desire for
gain. Let those who do want more money go in for this business.
If your advice is correct, Mr. Feilding can have no difficulty at all
in selling a share of the paper. People who want more money will
be only too eager to buy it.'</p>

<p>'My dear child, everybody wants more money.'</p>

<p>'I have quite enough. But why do you ask me to join you,
Zoe? I do not know Mr. Feilding, except as an acquaintance. He
is, I dare say, all that you think. But I do not find him personally
interesting. And there is no reason why I should pretend to be
one of the train who follow him and admire him.'</p>

<p>'But I want you&mdash;I want you, Armorel.' Zoe clasped her hands
and lifted her eyes, humid now. But a woman's eyes move a girl
less than a man. 'I want you, and none but you, to join me in
this. We two alone will do it. It will be such a splendid thing to
do! Nothing short of the rescue of the finest and most poetic
mind of the day from sordid cares and worries. Think of what
future ages will say of you!'</p>

<p>Armorel laughed. 'Indeed!' she said. 'This kind of immortality
does not tempt me very much. But, Zoe, it is really useless
to urge me. I could not do this, if I would. And truly I would
not if I could; for I made a promise to Mr. Jagenal, when I came
of age the other day, that I would not lend or part with any
money without taking his advice; and that I would not change
any of his investments without consulting him. I seem to know,
beforehand, what he would say if I consulted him about this
proposal.'</p>

<p>'Then, my dear,' said Zoe, lying back in her cushions and
turning her face to the fire, 'let us talk about the matter no
more.'</p>

<p>She had failed. From the outset she felt that she was going to
fail. The man had had every chance. He had met the girl
constantly: she had left him alone with her: but he had not
attracted her in the least. Well: she confessed, in spite of his
cleverness, Alec had somewhat of a wooden manner: he was
too authoritative; and Armorel was too independent. She had
failed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Armorel, for her part, remembered how her lawyer had warned
her on the day when she became twenty-one and of age to manage
her own affairs: all kinds of traps, he told her, are set to catch
women who have got money in order to rob them of their money:
they are besieged on every side, especially on the sides presumably
the weakest: she must put on the armour of suspicion: she must
never&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;here he held up a terrifying forefinger&mdash;enter
into any engagement or promise, verbal or in writing,
without consulting him. The memory of this warning made her
uneasy&mdash;because it was her own companion, the lady appointed
by her lawyer himself, who had made the first attempt upon
her money. True, the attempt was entirely disinterested. There
would be no gain to Zoe even if she were to accede: the
proposal was prompted by the purest friendship. And yet she
felt uneasy.</p>

<p>As for the disinterested companion, she wrote a letter that
very night. She said: 'I have made an attempt to get this money
for you. It has failed. It was hopeless from the first. You have
had your chance: you have been with the girl often enough to
attract and interest her: yet she is neither attracted nor interested.
I have given her your poems: she says they ought to be the
work of a woman: she likes the verse, but she cares nothing about
the poet. Strange! For my own part, I have been foolish enough
to love the man, and to care not one brass farthing about his
work. Your poems&mdash;your pictures&mdash;they all seem to me outside
yourself, and not a part of you at all. Why it is so I cannot
explain. Well, Alec, you planted me here, and I remain till you
tell me I may go. It is not very lively: the girl and I have
nothing in common: but it is restful and cosy, and I always did
like comfort and warmth. And Armorel pays all the bills. What
next, however? Is there any other way? What are my lord's
commands?'</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X_2" id="CHAPTER_X_2"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE SECRET OF THE TWO PICTURES</small></h2>


<p>A good many things troubled Armorel&mdash;the companion with whom
she could not talk: her persistent praises of Mr. Feilding: the
constant attendance of that illustrious genius&mdash;and she wanted
advice. Generally, she was a self-reliant person, but these were
new experiences. Effie, she knew, could not advise her. She might
go to Mr. Jagenal; but, then, elderly lawyers are not always
ready to receive confidences from young ladies. Then she thought
of her cousin Philippa, whom she had not seen since that first
evening. Philippa looked trustworthy and judicious. She went
to see her in the morning, when she would be alone. Philippa
received her with the greatest friendliness.</p>

<p>'If you really would like a talk about everything,' she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
'come to my own room.' She led the way. 'Here we shall be
quiet and undisturbed. It is the place where I practise every
day. But I shall never be able to play like you, dear. Now,
take that chair and let us begin. First, why do you come so
seldom?'</p>

<p>'Frankly and truly, do you wish me to come often?'</p>

<p>'Frankly and truly, fair cousin, yes. But come alone. Mrs.
Elstree and I were at school together, and we were not friends.
That is all. I hope you like her for a companion.'</p>

<p>'The first of my difficulties,' said Armorel, 'is that I do not. I
imagined when she came that it mattered nothing about her. You
see, I have been for five years under masters and teachers, and I
never thought anything about them outside the lesson. I thought
my companion would be only another master. But she isn't. I
have her company at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And all the
evening. I think I am wrong not to like her, because she is always
good-tempered. Somehow, she jars upon me. She likes everything
I do not care about&mdash;comic operas, dance music, French
novels. She has no feeling for pictures, and her taste in literature
is ... not mine. Oh, I am talking scandal. And she is so perfectly
inoffensive. Mostly she lies by the fire and either dozes or
reads her French novels. All day long, I go about my devices.
But there is the evening.'</p>

<p>'This is rather unfortunate, Armorel, is it not?'</p>

<p>'If it were only for a month or two, one would not mind. Tell
me, Philippa, how long must I have a companion?'</p>

<p>Philippa laughed. 'I dare say the question may solve itself
before long. Women generally achieve independence&mdash;with the
wedding ring&mdash;unless that brings worse slavery.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Armorel, gravely, 'I shall not achieve independence
that way.'</p>

<p>'Not that way?'</p>

<p>'Not by marrying!'</p>

<p>'Why not, Armorel?'</p>

<p>'You will not laugh at me, Philippa? I learned a long time
ago that I could only marry one kind of man. And now I cannot
find him.'</p>

<p>'You did know such a man formerly? My dear, you are not
going to let a childish passion ruin your own life.'</p>

<p>'I knew a man who was, in my mind, this kind of man. He
came across my life for two or three weeks. When he went
away I kept his image in my mind, and it gradually grew as I grew&mdash;always
larger and more beautiful. The more I learned&mdash;the
more splendid grew this image. It was an Idol that I set up and
worshipped for five long years.'</p>

<p>'And now your Idol is shattered?'</p>

<p>'No; the Idol remains. It is the man, who no longer corresponds
to the Idol. The man who might have become this wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Image is gone&mdash;and I can never love any other man. He must
be my Idol in the body.'</p>

<p>'But, Armorel, this is unreal. We are not angels. Men and
women must take each other with their imperfections.'</p>

<p>'My Idol may have had his imperfections, too. Well, the man
has gone. I am punished, perhaps, for setting up an Idol.'</p>

<p>She was silent for awhile, and Philippa had nothing to say.</p>

<p>'But about my companion?' Armorel went on. 'When can I
do without one?'</p>

<p>'There is nothing but opinion to consider. Opinion says that a
young lady must not live alone.'</p>

<p>'If one never hears what opinion says, one need not consider
opinion perhaps.'</p>

<p>'Well, but you could not go into society alone.'</p>

<p>'That matters nothing, because I never go into society at all.'</p>

<p>'Never go into society at all? What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'I mean that we go nowhere.'</p>

<p>'Well, what are people about? They call upon you, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'No; nobody ever calls.'</p>

<p>'But where are Mrs. Elstree's friends?'</p>

<p>'She has no friends.'</p>

<p>'Oh! She has&mdash;or had&mdash;an immense circle of friends.'</p>

<p>'That was before her father lost everything and killed himself.
They were fair-weather friends.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but one's own people don't run away because of misfortune.'
Philippa looked dissatisfied with the explanation. 'My dear
cousin, this must be inquired into. Your lawyer told me that Mrs.
Elstree's large circle of friends would be of such service to you.
Do you really mean that you go nowhere? And your wonderful
playing absolutely wasted? And your face seen nowhere? Oh! it
is intolerable that such a girl as you should be so neglected.'</p>

<p>'I have other friends. There is Effie Wilmot and her brother
who wants to become a dramatist. And I have found an old
friend, an artist. I am not at all lonely. But in the evening, I
confess, it is dull. I am not afraid of being alone. I have always
been alone. But now I am not alone. I have to talk.'</p>

<p>'And uncongenial talk.'</p>

<p>'Now advise me, Philippa. Her talk is always on one subject&mdash;always
the wonderful virtues of Mr. Feilding.'</p>

<p>'My cousin Alec? Yes'&mdash;Philippa changed colour, and shaded
her face with a hand-screen. 'I believe she knows him.'</p>

<p>'Your cousin? Oh! I had forgotten. But it is all the better,
because you know him. Philippa, I am troubled about him. For
not only does Zoe talk about him perpetually, but he is always
calling on one pretext or other. If I go to a picture-gallery, he is
there: if I walk in the park, I meet him: if I go to church&mdash;Zoe
does not go&mdash;he meets me in the porch: if we go to the theatre, he
is there.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>'I did not think that Alec was that kind of man,' said Philippa,
still keeping the hand-screen before her face. 'Are you mistaken,
perhaps? Has he said anything?'</p>

<p>'No: he has said nothing. But it annoys me to have this man
following me about&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Philippa&mdash;he is your cousin&mdash;I
know&mdash;but I detest him.'</p>

<p>'Can you not show that you dislike his attentions? If he will
not understand that you dislike him&mdash;wait&mdash;perhaps he will speak&mdash;though
I hardly think&mdash;you may be mistaken, dear. If he speaks,
let your answer be quite unmistakable.'</p>

<p>'Then I hope that he will speak to-morrow. Zoe wanted me to
find some money in order to help him in some way&mdash;out of some
worries.'</p>

<p>'My dear child&mdash;I implore you&mdash;do not be drawn into any
money entanglements. What does Zoe mean? What does it all
mean? My dear, there is something here that I cannot understand.
What can it mean? Zoe to help my cousin out of worries about
money? Zoe? What has Zoe to do with him and his worries?'</p>

<p>'He has been very kind to her and to her husband.'</p>

<p>'There is something we do not understand,' Philippa repeated.</p>

<p>'You are not angry with me for not liking your cousin?'</p>

<p>'Angry? No, indeed. He has been so spoiled with his success
that I don't wonder at your not liking him. As for me, you know,
it is different. I knew Alec before his greatness became visible.
No one, in the old days, ever suspected the wonderful powers he
has developed. When he was a boy, no one knew that he could
even hold a pencil, nobody suspected him of making rhymes&mdash;and
now see what he has done. Yet, after all, his achievements seem
to me only like incongruous additions stuck on to a central house.
Alec and painting don't go together, in my mind. Nor Alec and
vers de société. Nor Alec and story-telling. In his youth he
passed for a practical lad, full of common-sense and without
imagination.'</p>

<p>'Was he of a sensitive, highly nervous temperament?'</p>

<p>'Not to my knowledge. He has been always, and is still, I
think, a man of a singularly calm and even cold temper&mdash;not in the
least nervous nor particularly sensitive.'</p>

<p>Armorel compared this estimate with that of her companion.
Strange that two persons should disagree so widely in their estimate
of a man.</p>

<p>'Then, three or four years ago, he suddenly blossomed out into
a painter. He invited his friends to his chambers. He told us
that he had a little surprise for us. And then he drew aside a curtain
and disclosed the first picture he thought worthy of exhibition.
It hangs on the wall above your head, Armorel, with its companion
of the following year. My father bought them and gave them
to me.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Armorel got up to look at them.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she cried. 'These are copies!'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="454" height="600" alt="&#39;Oh!&#39; she cried. &#39;These are copies!&#39;" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>&#39;Oh!&#39; she cried. &#39;These are copies!&#39;</i></span>
</div>

<p>'Copies? No. They are Alec's own original pictures. What
makes you think they are copies?'</p>

<p>What made her think that they were copies was the very remarkable
fact that both pictures represented scenes among the
Scilly Isles: that in each of them was represented&mdash;herself&mdash;as a
girl of fifteen or sixteen: that the sketches for both these pictures
had been made in her own presence by the artist: that he was
none other than Roland Lee: and that the picture she had seen in
his studio was done by the same hand and in the same style as the
two pictures before her. Of that she had no doubt. She had so
trained her eye and hand that there could be no doubt at all of that
fact.</p>

<p>She stared, bewildered. Philippa, who was beside her looking
at the pictures, went on talking without observing the sheer amazement
in Armorel's eyes.</p>

<p>'That was his first picture,' she continued; 'and this was the
second. I remember very well the little speech he made while we
were all crowding round the picture. "I am going," he said, "to
make a new departure. You all thought I was just following the
beaten road at the Bar. Well, I am trying a new and a shorter way
to success. You see my first effort." It was difficult to believe our
eyes. Alec a painter? One might as well have expected to find
Alec a poet: and in a few months he was a poet: and then a story-teller.
And his poetry is as good as it is made in these days; and
his short stories are as good as any of those by the French
writers.'</p>

<p>'What is the subject of this picture?' Armorel asked with an
effort.</p>

<p>'The place is somewhere on the Cornish coast, I believe. He
always paints the same kind of picture&mdash;always a rocky coast&mdash;a
tossing sea&mdash;perhaps a boat&mdash;spray flying over the rocks&mdash;and
always a girl, the same girl. There she is in both pictures&mdash;a
handsome black-haired girl, quite young&mdash;it might be almost a
portrait of yourself when you were younger, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'Almost,' said Armorel.</p>

<p>'This girl is now as well known to Alec's friends as Wouvermann's
white horse. But no one knows the model.'</p>

<p>Armorel's memory went back to the day when Roland made
that sketch. She stood&mdash;so&mdash;just as the painter had drawn her,
on a round boulder, the water boiling and surging at her feet and
the white foam running up. Behind her the granite rock, grey
and black. How could she ever forget that sketch?</p>

<p>'Alec is wonderful in his seas,' Philippa went on. 'Look at
the bright colour and the clear transparency of the water. You can
feel it rolling at your feet. Upon my word, Armorel, the girl is
really like you.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>'A little, perhaps. Yes; they are good pictures, Philippa.
The man who painted them is a painter indeed.'</p>

<p>She sat down again, still bewildered.</p>

<p>Presently she heard Philippa's voice. 'What is it?' she asked.
'You have become deaf and dumb. Are you ill?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;I am not ill. The sight of those pictures set me thinking.
I will go now, Philippa. If he speaks to me I will reply so
that there can be no mistake. But if he persists in following me
about, I will ask you to interfere.'</p>

<p>'If necessary,' Philippa promised her. 'I will interfere for
you. But there is something in all this which I do not understand.
Come again soon, dear, and tell me everything.'</p>

<p>When they began this talk, one girl was a little troubled, but
not much. The other was free from any trouble. When they
parted, both girls were troubled.</p>

<p>One felt, vaguely, that danger was in the air. Zoe meant
something by constantly talking about her cousin Alec. What
understanding was there between him and that woman&mdash;that
detestable woman?</p>

<p>The other walked home in a doubt and perplexity that drove
everything else out of her head. What did those pictures mean?
Had Roland given away his sketches? Was there another painter
who had the very touch of Roland as well as his sketches? No,
no; it was impossible.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered something on the fragment of paper
that Effie picked up. The corner of the torn cheque&mdash;even the
signature of Alec Feilding. What did that mean? Why had
Roland torn up a cheque signed by Mr. Feilding? Why had he
called that act the turning of the footstep?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_2" id="CHAPTER_XI_2"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>A CRITIC ON TRUTH</small></h2>


<p>One painter may make use of another man's sketches for his own
pictures. The thing is conceivable, though one cannot recall, and
there is no record of, any such case. It is, perhaps, possible.
Portrait-painters have employed other men to paint backgrounds
and even hands and drapery. Now, the two pictures hanging in
Philippa's room were most certainly painted from Roland's sketches.
If there were any room for doubt the figure of Armorel herself in
the foreground removed that doubt. Therefore, Roland must have
lent his sketches to Mr. Feilding. What else did he lend? Can
one man lend another his eye, his hand, his sense of colour, his
touch, his style? There was once, I seem to have read, a man who
sold his soul to the only Functionary who buys such things, and
keeps a stock of them second-hand, on the condition that he should
be able to paint as well as the immortal Raffaello. He obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
his wish, because the Devil always keeps his bargain to the letter,
with the result that, instead of winning the imperishable wreath
for himself that he expected, he was never known at all, and his
pictures are now sold as those of the master whose works they so
miraculously resemble. Armorel had perhaps heard this story somewhere.
Could the cleverest man in all London have made a similar
transaction, taking Roland Lee for his model? If so, the Devil
had not cheated him at all, and he got out of the bargain all he
expected, because he not only painted quite as well as his master,
and in exactly the same style, so that it was impossible to distinguish
between them, but, which the other unfortunate did not get,
all the credit was given to him, while the original model or master
languished in obscurity.</p>

<p>It was obvious to a trained eye, at very first sight, that the style
of the pictures was that of Roland Lee. He had a style of his
own. The first mark of genius in any art is individuality. His
style was no more to be imitated in painting than the style of
Robert Browning can be followed in poetry. Painters there are
who have been imitated and have created a school of imitators:
even these can always be distinguished from their copyists. The
subtle touch of the master, the personal presence of his hand, cannot
be copied or imitated. In these two pictures the hand of
Roland was clearly, unmistakably visible. The light thrown over
them, the atmosphere with which they were charged&mdash;everything
was his. He had caught the September sunshine as it lies over
and enfolds the Scilly Islands&mdash;who should know that soft and
golden light better than Armorel?&mdash;he had caught the transparencies
of the seas, the shining yellows of the sea-weed, the browns
and purples of bramble and fern, the greyness and the blackness of
the rock: you could hear the rush of the water eddying among the
boulders; you could see the rapid movement of the sea-gulls' wings
as they swept along with the wind. Could another, even with the
original sketches lying before him, even with skill and feeling of
his own, reproduce these things in Roland's own individual style?</p>

<p>'No,' she cried, but not aloud; 'I know these pictures. They
are not his at all. They are Roland's.'</p>

<p>Every line of thought that she followed&mdash;to write these down
would be to produce another 'Ring and Book'&mdash;in her troubled
meditations after the discovery led her to the same conclusion. It
was that at which she had arrived in a single moment of time,
without argument or reasoning, and at the very first sight of the
pictures. The first thought is always right. 'They are Roland's
pictures'&mdash;that was the first thought. The second thought brings
along the doubts, suggests objections, endeavours to be judicial,
deprecates haste, and calls for the scales. 'They cannot,' said the
second thought, 'be Roland's paintings, because Mr. Feilding
says they are his.' The third thought, which is the first strengthened
by evidence, declared emphatically that they were Roland's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
whatever Mr. Feilding might say, and could be the work of none
other.</p>

<p>Therefore, the cleverest man in all London, according to everybody,
the best and most generous and most honourable, according
to Armorel's companion, was an impostor and a Liar. Never before
had she ever heard of such a Liar.</p>

<p>Armorel, it is true, knew but little of the crooked paths by
which many men perform this earthly pilgrimage from the world
which is to the world which is to come. Children born on Samson&mdash;nay,
even those also of St. Mary's&mdash;have few opportunities of
observing these ways. That is why all Scillonians are perfectly
honest: they do not know how to cheat&mdash;even those who might
wish to become dishonest, if they knew. In her five years'
apprenticeship the tree of knowledge had dropped some of its baleful
fruit at Armorel's feet: that cannot be avoided even in a convent
garden. Yet she had not eaten largely of the fruit, nor with
the voracity that distinguishes many young people of both sexes
when they get hold of these apples. In other words, she only knew
of craft and falsehood in general terms, as they are set forth in the
Gospels and by the Apostles, and especially in the Book of Revelation,
which expressly states the portion of liars. Yet, even with
this slight foundation to build upon, Armorel was well aware that
here was a fraud of a most monstrous character. Surely, there
never was, before this man, any man in the world who dared to
present to the world another man's paintings, and to call them his
own? Men and women have claimed books which they never wrote&mdash;witness
the leading case of the false George Eliot and the story
told by Anthony Trollope; men have pretended to be well-known
writers&mdash;did I not myself once meet a man in an hotel pretending
to be one of our most genial of story-tellers? Men have written
things and pretended that they were the work of famous hands.
Literature&mdash;alas!&mdash;hath many impostors. But in Art the record
is clean. There are a few ghosts, to be sure, here and there&mdash;sporadic
spectres!&mdash;but they are obscure and mostly unknown.
Armorel had never heard or seen any of them. Surely there never
before was any man like unto this man!</p>

<p>And, apart from the colossal impudence of the thing, she began
to consider the profound difficulties in carrying it out. Because,
you see, no one man, unaided, could carry it through. It requires
the consent, the silence, and the active&mdash;nay, the zealous&mdash;cooperation
of another man. And how are you to get that man?</p>

<p>In order to get this other man&mdash;this active and zealous fellow-conspirator&mdash;you
must find means to persuade him to sacrifice every
single thing that men care for&mdash;honour, reputation, success. He must
be satisfied to pursue Art, actually and literally, for Art's own sake.
This is, I know, a rule of conduct preached by every art critic, every
æsthete, every lecturer or writer on Art. Yet observe what it may
lead to. Was there, for instance, an unknown genius who gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
his work to Giotto, with permission to call it his own? And was
that obscure genius content to sit and watch that work in the crowd,
unseen and unsuspected, while he murmured praises and thanksgiving
for the skill of hand and eye which had been given to him,
but claimed by that other young man, Messer Giotto? Did Turner
have his ghost? Sublime sacrifice of self! So to pursue Art for
Art's sake as to give your pictures to another man by which he may
rise to honour&mdash;even, it may be, to the Presidency of the Royal
Academy, contented only with the consciousness of good and sincere
work, and with the possession of mastery! It is beyond us: we
cannot achieve this greatness&mdash;we cannot rise to this devotion.
Art hath no such votaries. By what persuasions, then&mdash;by what
bribes&mdash;was Roland induced to consent to his own suicide&mdash;ignoble,
secret, and shameful suicide?</p>

<p>He must have consented; in no other way could the thing be
done. He must have agreed to efface himself&mdash;but not out of pure
devotion to Art. Not so. The Roland of the past survived still.
The burning desire for distinction and recognition still flamed in
his soul. The bitterness and shame with which he spoke of himself
proved that his consent had been wrung from him. He was ashamed.
Why? Because another bore the honours that should be his. Because
he was a bondman of the impostor. Of this Armorel was
certain. Roland Lee&mdash;the man whom for five long years she had
imagined to be marching from triumph to triumph&mdash;conqueror of
the world&mdash;had sold himself&mdash;for what consideration she knew not&mdash;hand
and eye, genius and brain, heart and soul&mdash;had sold himself
into slavery. He had consented to a monstrous and most impudent
fraud! And the man who stood before the canvas in public,
writing his name in the corner, was&mdash;the noun appellative, the
proper noun&mdash;belonging to such an act. And her own friend&mdash;her
gallant hero of Art&mdash;what else was he in this conspiracy of two?
You cannot persuade a woman&mdash;such is the poverty of the feminine
imagination&mdash;to call a thing like this by any other name than its
plain, simple, and natural one. A man may explain away, find
excuses, make suggestions, point out extenuating circumstances,
show how the force of events destroys free will, and propose a
surplice and a golden crown for the unfortunate victim of fate,
instead of bare shoulders and the nine-clawed cat. But a woman&mdash;never.
If the thing done is a Lie, the man who did it is a &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Armorel,' said her companion&mdash;it was in the afternoon, and
she had been dozing after her lunch&mdash;'what is the matter? You
have been sitting in the window, which has a detestable view of a
dismal street, for two long hours without talking. At lunch you
sat as if in a dream. Are you ill? Has anything happened? Has
the respectable Mr. Jagenal robbed you of your money? Has
Philippa been saying amiable things about me?'</p>

<p>'I have found out something which has disquieted me beyond
expression,' said Armorel, gravely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Zoe changed colour. 'Heavens!'&mdash;she laughed curiously.
'What has come out now? Anything about me? One never
knows what may come out next. It is very odd what a lot of things
may be said about everybody.'</p>

<p>'My discovery has nothing to do with you, at least&mdash;no, nothing
at all.'</p>

<p>'That is reassuring.' It certainly was, as everybody knows who
does not wish the curtain to draw up once again on the earlier and
half-forgotten scenes of the play. 'Perhaps it might relieve you,
dear, if you were to tell me. But do not think I am curious.
Besides, I dare say I could tell you more than you could tell me. Is
it about Philippa's hopeless attachment for the man who will never
marry her, and her cruelty to the reverend gentleman who will?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no: it is nothing about Philippa. I know nothing about
any attachments.'</p>

<p>'Well, you will tell me when you please.' Zoe relapsed into
warmth and silence. But she watched the girl from under her
heavy eyelids. Something had happened&mdash;something serious.
Armorel pursued her meditations, but in a different line. She now
remembered that the leader in this Fraud was the man whom Zoe
professed to honour above all other living men: could she tell this
disciple what she had discovered? One might as well inform
Kadysha that her prophet Mohammed was an epileptic impostor.
And, again, he was Philippa's first cousin, and she regarded him
with pride, if not&mdash;as Zoe suggested&mdash;with a warmer feeling still.
How could she bring this trouble upon Philippa?</p>

<p>And, again, it was Roland's secret. How could she reveal a
thing which would cover him with ridicule and discredit for the
rest of his life? She must be silent for the sake of everybody.</p>

<p>'Zoe,' she sprang to her feet, 'don't ask me anything more.
Forget what I said. It is not my own secret.'</p>

<p>'My dear child,' Zoe murmured, 'if nobody has run away with
your money, and if you have found out no mares' nests about me,
I don't mind anything. I have already quite forgotten. Why
should I remember?'</p>

<p>'Of course,' Armorel repeated impatiently&mdash;this companion of
hers often made her impatient&mdash;'there is nothing about you. It
concerns&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mr. Feilding.'</p>

<p>It was only an innocent maid who opened the door to announce
an afternoon caller; but Armorel started, for really it was the right
completion to her sentence, though not the completion she meant to
make.</p>

<p>He came in&mdash;the man of whom her mind was full&mdash;tall, handsome,
calm, and self-possessed. Authority sat, visible to all, upon
his brow. His dress, his manner, his voice, proclaimed the man
who had succeeded&mdash;who deserved to succeed. Oh! how could it
be possible?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Armorel mechanically gave him her hand, wondering. Then,
quite in the old style, and as a survival of Samson Island, there
passed rapidly through her mind the whole procession of those texts
which refer to liars. For the moment she felt curious and nervously
excited, as one who should talk with a man condemned. Then she
came back to London and to the exigencies of the situation. Yet it
was really quite wonderful. For he sat down and began to talk for
all the world as if he was a perfectly truthful person: and she rang
the bell for tea, and poured it out for him, as if she knew nothing
to the contrary. That he, being what he was, should so carry himself;
that she, who knew everything, should sit down calmly and
put milk and sugar in his tea, were two facts so extraordinary that
her head reeled.</p>

<p>Presently, however, she began to feel amused. It was like
knowing beforehand, so that the mind is free to think of other
things, the story and the plot of a comedy. She considered the
acting and the make-up. And both were admirable. The part of
successful genius could not be better played. One has known
genius too modest to accept the position, happiest while sitting in a
dark corner. Here, however, was genius stepping to the front and
standing there boldly in sight of all, as if the place was his by the
double right of birth and of conquest.</p>

<p>He sat down and began to talk of Art. He seldom, indeed,
talked about anything else. But Art has many branches, and he
talked about them all. To-day, however, he discoursed on drawing
and painting. He was accustomed to patient listeners, and therefore
he assumed that his discourse was received with respect, and
did not observe the preoccupied look on the face of the girl to
whom he discoursed&mdash;for Zoe made no pretence of listening, except
when the conversation seemed likely to take a personal turn. Nor
did he observe how from time to time Armorel turned her eyes
upon him&mdash;eyes full of astonishment&mdash;eyes struck with amazement.</p>

<p>Presently he descended for awhile from the heights of principle
to the lower level of personal topic. 'Mrs. Elstree tells me,' he
said, smiling with some condescension, 'that you paint&mdash;of course
as an amateur&mdash;as well as play. If you can draw as well as you can
play you are indeed to be envied. But that is, perhaps, too much
to be expected. Will you show me some of your work? And will
you&mdash;without being offended&mdash;suffer me to be a candid critic?'</p>

<p>Armorel went gravely to her own room and returned with a
small portfolio full of drawings which she placed before him, still
with the wonder in her eyes. What would he say&mdash;this man who
passed off another man's pictures for his own? She stood at the
table over him, looking down upon him, waiting to see him betray
himself&mdash;the first criminal person&mdash;the first really wicked man&mdash;she
had ever encountered in the flesh.</p>

<p>'You are not afraid of the truth?' he asked, turning over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sketches. 'In Art&mdash;truth&mdash;truth is everything. Without truth
there is no Art. Truth and sincerity should be our aim in criticism
as well as in Art itself.'</p>

<p>Oh! what kind of conscience could this man have who was able
so to talk about Art, seeing what manner of man he was? Armorel
glanced at Zoe, half afraid that he would convict himself in her
presence. But she seemed asleep, lying back in her cushions.</p>

<p>His remarks were judgments. Once pronounced, there was no
appeal. Yet his judgments produced no effect upon the girl, not
the least. She listened, she heard, she acquiesced in silence.</p>

<p>Perhaps because he was struck with her coldness he left off examining
the sketches, and began a learned little discourse about
composition and harmony, selection and grouping. He illustrated
these remarks, not obtrusively, but quite naturally, by referring to
his own pictures, appealing to Zoe, who lazily raised her head and
murmured response, as one who knew it all beforehand. Now, as
to the discourse itself, Armorel recognised every word of it already:
she had read and had been taught these very things. It showed,
she thought, what a pretender the man must be not to understand
work that had been done by one who had studied seriously, and
already knew all that he was laboriously enforcing. But she said
nothing. It was, moreover, the lesson of a professor, not of an
artist. Between the professional critic who can neither paint nor
draw and the smallest of the men who can paint and draw there is,
if you please, a gulf fixed that cannot be passed over.</p>

<p>'This drawing, for instance,' he concluded, taking up one from
the table, 'betrays exactly the weakness of which I have been
speaking. It has some merit. There is a desire for truth&mdash;without
truth what are we? The lights are managed with some
dexterity, the colour has real feeling. But consider this figure.
From sheer ignorance of the elementary considerations which I
have been laying down, you have placed it exactly in front. Had
it been here, at the right, the effect of the figure in bringing up the
whole of the picture would have been heightened tenfold. For my
own part, I always like a figure in a painting&mdash;a single figure for
choice&mdash;a girl, because the treatment of the hair and the dress
lends itself to effect.'</p>

<p>'His famous girl!' echoed Zoe. 'That model whom nobody is
allowed to see!'</p>

<p>Now, the figure was placed in the middle for very excellent
reasons, and in full consideration of those very principles which
this expounder had been setting forth. But what yesterday would
have puzzled her, now amused her one moment and irritated her
the next.</p>

<p>He took up a crayon. 'Shall I show you,' he asked, 'exactly
what I mean?'</p>

<p>'If you please. Here is a piece of paper which will do.'</p>

<p>He spoke in the style which Matthew Arnold so much admired&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Grand Style&mdash;the words clear and articulate, the emphasis just,
the manner authoritative. 'I will just indicate your background,'
he said, poising the pencil professionally&mdash;he looked as if the Grand
Style really belonged to him&mdash;'in two or three strokes, and then
I will sketch in your figure in the place&mdash;here&mdash;where it properly
belongs. You will see immediately, though, of course&mdash;your eye&mdash;cannot&mdash;&mdash;'
He played with the chalk as one considering where
to begin&mdash;but he did not begin. Armorel remembered a certain
day when Roland gave her his first lesson, pencil in hand. Never
was that pencil idle: it moved about of its own accord: it was
drawing all the time: it seemed to be drawing out of its own head.
Mr. Feilding, on the other hand, never touched the paper at all.
His pencil was dumb and lifeless. But Armorel waited anxiously
for him to begin. Now, at any rate, she should see if he could
draw. She was disappointed. The clock on the overmantel
suddenly struck six. Mr. Feilding dropped the crayon. 'Good
heavens!' he cried. 'You make one forget everything, Miss Rosevean.
We must put off the rest of this talk for another day. But
you will persevere, dear young lady, will you not? Promise me
that you will persevere. Even if the highest peak cannot be
attained&mdash;we may not all reach that height&mdash;it is something to
stand upon the lower slope, if it is only to recognise the greatness
of those who are above and the depths below&mdash;how deep they are!&mdash;of
the world which knows no art. Persevere&mdash;persevere! I will
call again and help you, if I may.' He pressed her hand warmly,
and departed.</p>

<p>'I really think,' said Zoe, 'that he believes you worth teaching,
Armorel. I have never known him give so much time to any one
girl before. And if you only knew how they flock about him!'</p>

<p>'Zoe,' said Armorel, without answering this remark, 'you have
seen all Mr. Feilding's pictures, have you not?'</p>

<p>'I believe, all.'</p>

<p>'Do they all treat the same subject?'</p>

<p>'Up to the present, he has exhibited nothing but sea and coast
pieces, headlands, low tide on the rocks, and so forth. Always
with this black-haired girl&mdash;something like you, but not much more
than a child.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever see him actually at work?'</p>

<p>'You mean working at an unfinished thing? No; never. He
cannot endure anyone in his studio while he is at work.'</p>

<p>'Did he ever draw anything for you&mdash;any pen-and-ink sketch&mdash;pencil
sketch? Have you got any of his sketches&mdash;rough things?'</p>

<p>'No. Alec has a secretive side to his character. It comes out
in odd ways. No one suspected that he could paint, or even draw,
until, three or four years ago, he suddenly burst upon us with a
finished picture; and then it came out that he had been secretly
drawing all his life, and studying seriously for years. Where he
will break out next, I don't know.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>'He may break out anywhere,' said Armorel, 'except upon the
fiddle. I think that he will never play the fiddle. Yes, Zoe, he
really is a very, very clever man. He is certainly the very cleverest
man in all London.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII_2" id="CHAPTER_XII_2"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>TO MAKE THAT PROMISE SURE</small></h2>


<p>There are few instincts and impulses of imperfect human nature
more deeply rooted or more certain to act upon us than the desire
to 'have it out' with some other human creature. Women are
especially led or driven by this impulse, even among the less highly
civilised to the tearing out of nose- and ear-rings. You may hear
every day at all hours in every back street of every city the ladies
having it out with each other. In fact there is a perpetual court of
Common Pleas being held in these streets, without respite of
holiday or truce, in which the folk have it out with each other,
while friends&mdash;sympathetic friends&mdash;stand by and act as judges,
jury, arbitrators, lawyers, and all. Things are reported, things
are said, things are done, a personal explanation is absolutely
necessary, before peace of mind can be restored, or the way to
future action become clearly visible. The two parties must have
it out.</p>

<p>In Armorel's case she found that before doing anything she
must see that member of the conspiracy&mdash;if, indeed, there was a
conspiracy&mdash;who was her own friend: she must see Roland. She
must know exactly what it meant, if only to find out how it could
be stopped. In plain words, she must have it out. Those who
obey a natural impulse generally believe that they are acting by
deliberate choice. Thus the doctrine of free will came to be invented:
and thus Armorel, when she took a cab to the other
studio, had no idea but that she was acting the most original part
ever devised for any comedy.</p>

<p>As before, she found the artist in his dingy back room, alone.
But the picture was advancing. When she saw it, a fortnight
before, it was little more than the ghost of a rock with a spectral
sea and a shadowy girl beside the sea. Now, it was advanced so
far that one could see the beginnings of a fine painting in it.</p>

<p>Roland stepped forward and greeted his old friend. Why&mdash;he
was already transformed. What had he done to himself? The
black bar was gone from his forehead: his eyes were bright: his
cheeks had got something of their old colour: his hair was trimmed,
and his dress, as well as his manner, showed a return to self-respect.</p>

<p>'What happy thought brings you here again, Armorel?' he
asked, with the familiarity of an old friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>'I came to see you at work. Last time I came only to see you.
Is it permitted?'</p>

<p>'Behold me! I am at work. See my picture&mdash;all there is
of it.'</p>

<p>Armorel looked at it long and carefully. Then she murmured
unintelligibly, 'Yes, of course. But there never could have been
any doubt.' She turned to the artist a face full of encouragement.
'What did I prophesy for you, Roland? That you should be a
great painter? Well, my prophecy will come true.'</p>

<p>'I hope, but I fear. I am beginning the world again.'</p>

<p>'Not quite. Because you have never ceased to work. Your
hand is firmer and your eye is truer now than it was four years ago,
when you&mdash;ceased to exhibit. But you have never ceased to work.
So that you go back to the world with better things.'</p>

<p>'They refused to buy my things before.'</p>

<p>'They will not refuse now. Nay, I am certain. Don't think
of money, my old friend: you must not&mdash;you shall not think of
money. Think of nothing but your work&mdash;and your name. What
ought to be done to a man who should forget his name? He
deserves to be deprived of his genius, and to be cast out among the
stupid. But you, Roland, you were always keen for distinction&mdash;were
you not?'</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>'How well I know the place,' she said, standing before the
picture. 'It is the narrow channel between Round Island and
Camber Rock. Oh! the dear, terrible place. When you and I
were there, you remember, Roland, the water was smooth and the
sea-birds were flying quietly. I have seen them driven by the
wind off the island and beating up against it like a sailing ship.
But in September there are no puffins. And I have seen the water
racing and roaring through the channel, dashing up the black sides
of the rocks&mdash;while we lay off, afraid to venture near. It was low
tide when you made your sketch. I remember the long, yellow
fringing sea-weed hanging from the rock six feet deep. And there
is your girl sitting in the boat. Oh! I remember her very well.
What a happy time she had while you were with her, Roland!
You were the very first person to show her something of the outer
world. It seemed, when you were gone, as if you had taken that
girl and planted her on a high rock so that she could see right
across the water to the world of men and Art. You always keep
this girl in your pictures?'</p>

<p>'Always in these pictures of coast and rock.'</p>

<p>'Roland, I want you to make a change. Do not paint the girl
of sixteen in this picture. Let me be your model instead. Put
me into the picture. It is my fancy. Will you let me sit for you
again?'</p>

<p>'Surely, Armorel, if I may. It will be&mdash;oh, but you cannot&mdash;you
must not come to this den of a place.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>'Indeed, I think it is not a nice place at all. But I shall stipulate
that you take another and a more decent studio immediately.
Will you do this?'</p>

<p>'I will do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;that you command.'</p>

<p>'You know what I want. The return of my old friend. He is
on his way back already.'</p>

<p>'I know&mdash;I know. But whether he ever can come back again I
know not. A shade or spectre of him, perhaps, or himself, besmirched
and smudged, Armorel&mdash;dragged through the mud.'</p>

<p>'No. He shall come back&mdash;himself&mdash;in spotless robes. Now
you shall take a studio, and I will come and sit to you. I may
bring my little friend, Effie Wilmot, with me? That is agreed, then.
You will go, Sir, this very morning and find a studio. Have you
gone back to your old friends?'</p>

<p>'Not yet. I had very few friends. I shall go back to them
when I have got work to show. Not before.'</p>

<p>'I think you should go back as soon as you have taken your
new studio. It will be safer and better. You have been too much
alone. And there is another thing&mdash;a very important thing&mdash;the
other night you made me a promise. You tore up something
that looked like a cheque. And you assured me that this meant
nothing less than a return to the old paths.'</p>

<p>'When I tore up that accursed cheque, Armorel, I became a
free man.'</p>

<p>'So I understood. But when one talks of free men one implies
the existence of the master or owner of men who are not free.
Have you signified to that master or owner your intention to be
his bondman no longer?'</p>

<p>'No. I have not.'</p>

<p>'This man, Roland,' she laid her hand on his, 'tell me frankly,
has he any hold upon you?'</p>

<p>'None.'</p>

<p>'Can he injure you in any way? Can he revenge himself upon
you? Is there any old folly or past wickedness that he can bring
up against you?'</p>

<p>'None. I have to begin the world again: that is the outside
mischief.'</p>

<p>'All your pictures you have sold to this man, Roland, with me
in every one?'</p>

<p>'Yes, all. Spare me, Armorel! With you in every one. Forgive
me if you can!'</p>

<p>'I understand now, my poor friend, why you were so cast
down and ashamed. What? You sold your genius&mdash;your holy,
sacred genius&mdash;the spirit that is within you! You flung yourself
away&mdash;your name, which is yourself&mdash;you became nothing, while
this man pretends that the pictures&mdash;yours&mdash;were his! He puts
his name to them, not your own&mdash;he shows them to his friends in
the room that he calls his studio&mdash;he sends them to the exhibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
as his own&mdash;and yet you have been able to live! Oh, how could
you?&mdash;how could you? Oh! it was shameful&mdash;shameful&mdash;shameful!
How could you, Roland? Oh, my master!&mdash;I have loaded
you with honour&mdash;oh, how could you?&mdash;how could you?'</p>

<p>The vehemence of her indignation soon revived the old shame.
Roland hung his head.</p>

<p>'How could I?' he repeated. 'Yes, say it again&mdash;ask the
question a thousand times&mdash;how could I?'</p>

<p>'Forgive me, Roland! I have been thinking about it continually.
It is a thing so dreadful, and yesterday something&mdash;an
unexpected something&mdash;brought it back to my mind&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;made
me understand more what it meant. And oh, Roland, how
could you? I thought, before, that you had only idled and trifled
away your time; but now I know. And again&mdash;again&mdash;again&mdash;how
could you?'</p>

<p>'It is no excuse&mdash;but it is an explanation&mdash;I do not defend
myself. Not the least in the world&mdash;but ... Armorel, I was
starving.'</p>

<p>'Starving?'</p>

<p>'I could not sell my pictures. No one wanted them. The
dealers would give me nothing but a few shillings apiece for them.
I was penniless, and I was in debt. A man who drops into London
out of Australia has no circle of friends and cousins who will stand
by him. I was alone. Perhaps I loved too well the luxurious life.
I tried for employment on the magazines and papers, but without
success. In truth, I knew not where to look for the next week's
rent and the next week's meals. I was a Failure, and I was penniless.
Do you ask more?'</p>

<p>'Then the man came&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'He came&mdash;my name was worth nothing&mdash;he asked me to
suppress it. My work&mdash;which no one would buy&mdash;he offered to
buy for what seemed, in my poverty, substantial prices if I would
let him call it his own. What was the bargain? A life of ease
against the bare chance of a name with the certainty of hard times.
I was so desperate that I accepted.'</p>

<p>'You accepted. Yes.... But you might have given it up at
any moment.'</p>

<p>'To be plunged back again into the penniless state. For the
life of ease, mark you, brought no ease but a bare subsistence.
Only quite lately, terrified by the success of the last picture, my
employer has offered to give me two thirds of all he gets. The
cheque you saw me tear up and burn was the first considerable sum
I have ever received. It is gone, and I am penniless again&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And now that you are penniless?'</p>

<p>'Now I shall pawn my watch and chain and everything else that
I possess. I shall finish this picture, and I will sell it for what the
dealers will give me for it. Too late, this year, for exhibition.
And so ... we shall see. If the worst comes I can carry a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of boards up and down Piccadilly, opposite to the Royal Academy,
and dream of the artistic life that once I hoped would be my own.'</p>

<p>'You will do better than that, Roland,' said Armorel, moved to
tears. 'Oh! you will make a great name yet. But this man&mdash;don't
tell me his name. Roland, promise me, please, not to tell
me his name. I want you&mdash;just now&mdash;to think that it is your own
secret&mdash;to yourself. If I should find it out, by accident, that would
be&mdash;just now&mdash;my secret&mdash;to myself. This man&mdash;you have not yet
broken with him?'</p>

<p>'Not yet.'</p>

<p>'Will you go to him and tell him that it is all over? Or will
you write to him?'</p>

<p>'I thought that I would wait, and let him come to me.'</p>

<p>'I would not, if I were you. I would write and tell him at
once, and plainly. Sit down, Roland, and write now&mdash;at once&mdash;without
delay. Then you will feel happier.'</p>

<p>'I will do what you command me,' he replied meekly. He had,
indeed, resolved with all his might and main that the rupture
should be made; but, as yet, he had not made it.</p>

<p>'Get paper, then, and write.'</p>

<p>He obeyed, and sat down. 'What shall I say?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Write: "After four years of slavery, I mean to become a man
once more. Our compact is over. You shall no longer put your
name to my works; and I will no longer share in the infamy of
this fraud. Find, if you can, some other starving painter, and buy
him. I have torn up your cheque, and I am now at work on a
picture which will be my own. If there is any awkwardness about
the subject and the style, in connection with the name upon it,
that awkwardness will be yours, not mine." So&mdash;will you read it
aloud? I think,' said Armorel, 'that it will do. He will probably
come here and bluster a little. He may even threaten. He may
weep. You will&mdash;Roland&mdash;are you sure&mdash;you will be adamant?'</p>

<p>'I swear, Armorel! I will be true to my promise.'</p>

<p>Armorel heaved a sigh. Would he stand steadfast? He might
have much to endure. Would he be able to endure hardness? It
is only the very young man who can be happy in a garret and live
contentedly on a crust. At twenty-six or twenty-seven, the age at
which Roland had now arrived, one is no longer quite so young.
The garret is dismal: the crust is insipid, unless there are solid
grounds for hope. Yet he had the solid grounds of improved work&mdash;good
work.</p>

<p>'Should you be afraid of him?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Afraid of him?' Roland laughed. 'Why, I never meet him
but I curse him aloud. Afraid of him? No. I have never been
afraid of anything but of becoming penniless. Poverty&mdash;destitution&mdash;is
an awful spectre. And not only poverty but&mdash;I confess,
with shame&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! man of little faith'&mdash;she did not want to hear the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of that confession&mdash;'you could not endure a single hour. You did
this awful thing for want of money.'</p>

<p>'I did,' said Roland, meekly.</p>

<p>'The Way of Pleasure and the Way of Wealth. I remember&mdash;you
told me long ago&mdash;they draw the young man by ropes. But
not the girl. Why not the girl? I have never felt this strange
yearning for riot and excess. In all the poetry, the novels, the
pictures, and the plays the young men are always being dragged by
ropes to the Way of Pleasure. Are men so different from women?
What does it mean&mdash;this yearning? I cannot understand it. What
is your Way of Pleasure that it should attract you so? Your
poetry and your novels cannot explain it. I see feasting in the
Way of Pleasure, drinking, singing, dancing, gambling, sitting up
all night, and love-making. As for work, there is none. Why
should the young man want to feast? It is like a City Alderman
to be always thinking of banquets. Why should you want to drink
wine perpetually? I suppose you do not actually get tipsy. If you
can sing and like singing, you can sing over your work, I suppose.
As for love-making'&mdash;she paused. The subject, where a young
man and a maiden discuss it, has to be treated delicately.</p>

<p>'I have always supposed'&mdash;she added, with hesitation, for experience
was lacking&mdash;'that two people fall in love when they are
fitted for each other. But in this, your wonderful Way of Pleasure,
the poets write as if every man was always wanting to make love to
every woman if she is pleasant to look at, and without troubling
whether she is good or bad, wise or silly. Oh! every woman! any
woman! there is neither dignity of manhood nor self-respect nor
respect to woman in this folly.'</p>

<p>'You cannot understand any of it, Armorel,' said Roland.
'We ought all of us to be flogged from Newgate to Tyburn.'</p>

<p>'That would not make me understand. Flora, Chloe, Daphne,
Amaryllis&mdash;they are all the same to the poet. A pretty girl seems
all that he cares for. Can that be love?'</p>

<p>'&mdash;And back again,' said Roland.</p>

<p>'Still I should not understand. In the poetry I think that
love-making comes first, and eating and drinking afterwards. As
for love-making,' she spoke philosophically, as one in search of
truth, 'as for love-making, I believe I could wait contentedly without
it until I found exactly the one man I could love. But that I
should take a delight in writing or singing songs about making love
to every man who was a handsome fellow&mdash;any man&mdash;every man&mdash;oh!
can one conceive such a thing? There is but one Way of
Pleasure to such as you, Roland. If I could paint so good a
picture as this is going to be, it would be a life-long joy. I should
never, never, never tire of it. I should want no other pleasure&mdash;nothing
better&mdash;than to work day after day, to work and study, to
watch and observe, to feel the mastery of hand and eye. Oh!
Roland&mdash;with this before you&mdash;with this'&mdash;she pointed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
picture&mdash;'you sold your soul&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;you!&mdash;for feasting and
drinking and&mdash;and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, Armorel: no. Everything else if you like, but not love-making.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII_2" id="CHAPTER_XIII_2"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE DRAMATIST</small></h2>


<p>If Mrs. Elstree was Armorel's official and authorised companion,
her private unpaid companion was Effie Wilmot. The official companion
was resident in the chambers, and was seen with her charge
at the theatres and concerts. The private unpaid companion went
about with her all day long, sat with her in her own room, knew
what she thought, and talked with her of the things she loved to
discuss. So that, though the representative of Order and Propriety
had less to do, the unpaid attachée had a much more lively time.
Fortunately, the official companion was best pleased when there
was nothing to do. In those days, when London was as yet an
unknown land to both of them, the girls went together to see things.
Nobody knows what a great quantity of things there are to see in
London when you once set yourself seriously to explore this great
unknown continent. Captain Magalhaens himself, crossing the
Pacific Ocean for the first time, did not experience a more interesting
and exciting time than these two girls in their walks in and
about the great town, new to both. They were as ravenous as
American tourists beginning their European round. And, like
them, they consulted their Baedeker, their Hare, and their Peter
Cunningham. Pictures there are, all in the West-End; museums,
with every kind of treasure; historic houses&mdash;alas! not many;
libraries; art galleries of all kinds; cathedrals, churches, ancient
and modern; old streets, whose paving-stones are inscribed in the
closest print with the most wonderful recollections; old sites,
broken fragments, even. Every morning the two girls wandered
forth, sometimes not coming home until late in the afternoon.
Then Effie went back to her lodging, and spent the evening working
at her verses; while Armorel practised her violin, or read and
dreamed away the time opposite her companion, who sat for the
most part in silence, gazing into the firelight, lying back in her
easy-chair beside the fire.</p>

<p>These ramblings belong to another book&mdash;the Book of the
Things Left Out. I could show you, dear reader, many curious and
interesting places visited by these two pilgrims, but one must not
in this place write these down, because Armorel's story is not
Armorel's history. Let us always be careful to distinguish. Besides,
the events which have to be related destroyed, as you will
see, the calm and tranquillity necessary for the proper enjoyment
of such ramblings. First, this discovery concerning the pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Who can visit old churches and museums with a mind full of wrath
and bitterness? So wrathful was Armorel in considering the impudence
of the fraud she had discovered: so bitter was she in considering
the cowardice of her old hero: that she even failed to
observe the unmistakable signs of trouble which at this time showed
themselves in her friend's face. If not a beautiful face, it was
expressive. When the projecting forehead showed a thick black
line: when the deep-set eyes were ringed with dark circles: when
the pale cheeks grew paler and more hollow: and when the girl,
who was generally so bright and animated, became silent and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distraite</i>, something was wrong.</p>

<p>'What is it, Effie?' Armorel asked, waking up. 'I have asked
you three questions, and have received no answer. And you are
looking ill. Has anything gone wrong?'</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Effie, 'it is horrid! You are in troubles of your
own, and you want me to add to them by telling you about
mine.'</p>

<p>'I am in trouble, dear. And it makes me selfish and blind.
You know partly what it is about. It is about the Life that has
gone wrong. I have found out why and how. But I can never
tell you or anybody. Never mind. Tell me about yourself.'</p>

<p>'It is more about my brother than myself. You know that
Archie has been writing a play?'</p>

<p>'Yes. You write verses which you have never shown me; and
your brother writes plays. I shall see both some day, perhaps.'</p>

<p>'Whenever you like. But Archie has now finished his play.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'That means to him more than I can possibly tell you. He has
been living for that play, and for nothing else. It has filled his
brain day and night. Never was so much trouble given to a play
before, I am sure. It is himself.'</p>

<p>'I understand.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;then&mdash;you will understand also what he feels when he
has been told that his play is utterly worthless.'</p>

<p>'Who told him that?'</p>

<p>'A great authority&mdash;a writer of great reputation&mdash;the only
living writer whom we have ever known.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;but&mdash;Effie, if a great authority says this, it is frightful.'</p>

<p>'It would be, but for one thing, which you shall hear afterwards.
However, he did confess that some of the situations were fine.
But the dialogue, he said, was unfitted for the stage, and no
manager would so much as look at the play.'</p>

<p>'Poor Archie! What a dreadful blow! What does he say?'</p>

<p>'He is utterly cast down. He sits at home and broods. Sometimes
he swears that he will tear up the thing and throw it into the
fire; sometimes he recovers a little of his old confidence in it.
He will not eat anything, and he does not sleep; and I can find
nothing to say that will comfort him. If I knew anyone who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
give him another opinion&mdash;the play cannot be so bad. Armorel,
will you read the play?'</p>

<p>'But, my dear, I am no critic. What would be the good of my
reading it?'</p>

<p>'I would rather have your criticism than'&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;'than
anybody's. Because you can feel&mdash;and you have the artist's soul;
and everybody has not&mdash;&mdash;though he may paint such beautiful
pictures,' she added rather obscurely.</p>

<p>'Well, I will read the play, or hear him read it, if you think it
will do him any good, Effie. I will go with you at once.'</p>

<p>'Oh! will you, really? Archie will be shy at first. The last
criticism caused him so much agony that he dreads another. But
yours will be sympathetic, at least. You will understand what he
meant, even if he has not succeeded&mdash;poor boy!&mdash;in putting on the
stage what was in his heart. When he sees that you do feel for
him, it will be different. Oh! Armorel!'&mdash;the tears rose to her
eyes&mdash;'you cannot know what that play has been to both of us.
We have talked over every situation: we have rehearsed all the
dialogue. I know it by heart, I think. I could recite the whole
of it, straight through. We have cried over it, and laughed over
it. I have dressed dolls for all the parts, and one of us made them
act while the other read the play. And, after all, to be told that
it is worthless! Oh! It is a shame! It is a shame! And it isn't
worthless. It is a great, a beautiful play. It is full of tenderness,
and of strength as well.'</p>

<p>'Let us go at once, Effie.'</p>

<p>'What a good thing it was for me that the Head of the Reading
Room sent me to you! I little thought I was going to make such
a friend'&mdash;she took Armorel's hand&mdash;'We had no friends&mdash;yes,
there was one, but he is no true friend. We have had no friends
at all, and we thought to make our way without any.'</p>

<p>'You came to London to conquer the world&mdash;such a great giant
of a world&mdash;you and your brother, Jack the Giant Killer.'</p>

<p>'Ah! But we had read, somewhere, that the world is a good-natured
giant. He only asks to be amused. If you make him
laugh or cry, and forget, somehow, his own troubles&mdash;the world is
full of troubles&mdash;he will give in at once. Archie was going to make
him laugh and cry; I was going to tickle him with pretty rhymes.
But you may play for him, act for him, dance for him, paint for
him, sing for him, make stories for him&mdash;anything that you will,
and he will be subdued. That is what we read, and we kept on
repeating this assurance to each other, but as yet we have not got
very far. The great difficulty seems to make him look at you and
listen to you.'</p>

<p>'My dear, you shall succeed.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The young dramatist was sitting at his table, as melancholy as
Keats might have been after the <i>Quarterly Review's</i> belabouring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
He looked wretched: there was no pretence at anything else: it
was unmitigated wretchedness. Despair sat upon his countenance,
visible for all to see: his hair had not apparently been brushed, nor
his collar changed, since the misery began: he seemed to have gone
to bed in his clothes. Trouble does thus affect many men. It
attacks even their clothes as well as their hair and their minds.
The manuscript was lying on the table before him, but the pen was
dry: he had no longer any heart to correct the worthless thing. It
was the hour of his deepest dejection. The day before he had
plucked up a little courage: perhaps the critic was wrong: to-day
all was blackness.</p>

<p>'Here is Armorel, Archie!' cried Effie, with the assumption of
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>'I have come to ask a favour,' said Armorel, taking the hand
that was mechanically extended. 'I hear that your play is finished,
and I am told that it is a beautiful play.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;it isn't,' said the author.</p>

<p>'And that an unkind critic has said horrid and unkind things
about it. And I want to read it, if I may. Oh! I am not a great
critic, but, indeed, Archie, I have some feeling for Art and for
things beautiful. May I read it?'</p>

<p>'The play is perfectly worthless,' he replied sternly, but with
signs of softening. 'It is only waste of time to read it. Better
throw it behind the fire!' He seized the manuscript as he spoke,
but he did not throw it behind the fire.</p>

<p>'Is your critic a dramatist?'</p>

<p>'No. He has never written a play that I know of. But he is
a great authority. Everybody would acknowledge that.'</p>

<p>'A critic who has never written a play may very easily make
mistakes,' said Armorel. 'You have only to read the critiques of
pictures in the papers written by men who cannot paint. They are
full of mistakes.'</p>

<p>'This man would not make a mistake, would he, Effie?'</p>

<p>'Well, dear, I think he might, and besides, remember what
he said at the conclusion.' Armorel sat down. 'Now,' she said,
'tell me first what the play is about, and then read it, or let Effie
read it. I am sure she will read it a great deal better than you.'</p>

<p>He hesitated. He was ashamed to show his miserable work
to a second critic. And yet he longed to have another opinion,
because, when he came to think about it, he could not understand
why the thing could be called worthless.</p>

<p>He yielded. He read, with faltering accents, the scenario
which he had prepared with so much pride. Now it was like unrolling
a canvas daubed for the scenery of Richardson's Show. He
took no more pride in it.</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Armorel, interrupting. 'This seems to me a very
fine situation.'</p>

<p>'My critic said that some of the situations were fine.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>He went on to the end without further interruption.</p>

<p>'Now, Effie,' said Armorel, 'you will read it aloud while your
brother plays it with his dolls. Then I am sure to catch the
points.'</p>

<p>Archie sat up, and began to place his dolls while Effie read. He
was so expert in manipulating his puppets that he made them
actually represent the piece, changing the groups every moment,
while Effie, dropping the manuscript, folded her arms and recited
the play, watching Armorel's face.</p>

<p>This was quite another kind of critic. It was such a critic as
the playwright loves when he sits in his box and watches the people
in the house&mdash;a face which is easily moved to laughter or to tears,
which catches the points and feels the story. There are thousands
of such faces in every theatre every night. It is for them that
the play is written, and not for the critic, who comes to show his
superiority by picking out faults and watching for slips. For two
hours, not pausing for the division of the acts, Effie went on, her
soft voice rising and falling, the passion indicated but repressed;
and Archie watched, and moved his groups, and the audience of
one sat motionless but not unmoved.</p>

<p>'What?' she cried, springing to her feet and clasping her hands.
It is easy for this fine gesture to become theatrical and unreal, but
Armorel was never unreal. 'He dared to call this splendid play&mdash;this
glorious play&mdash;oh, this beautiful, sweet, and noble play!'&mdash;here
Archie's eyes began to fill, and his lips to quiver: he was but
a young dramatist, and of praise he had as yet had none&mdash;'he
dared to call this worthless?'</p>

<p>'He said it was utterly worthless,' said Effie.</p>

<p>'He said,' Archie added, 'that the language was wholly unfitted
for the stage. And then&mdash;then&mdash;after he'd said that, he offered to
give me fifty pounds for it.'</p>

<p>'Fifty pounds for a play quite worthless?'</p>

<p>'On the condition that he was to bring it out himself if he
pleased, under his own name.'</p>

<p>'Oh! but this is monstrous! Can there be,' asked Armorel,
thinking of the pictures, 'two such men in London?'</p>

<p>'If I would let him call it his own! He wants to take my play&mdash;mine&mdash;to
do what he likes with it&mdash;to bring it out as if it was
his own! Never! Never! I would rather starve first.'</p>

<p>'What did you tell him?'</p>

<p>'He said that he would wait for an answer. I have sent him
none as yet.'</p>

<p>'When you do,' said Armorel, 'let there be no hesitation or
possibility of mistaking. Oh! If I could tell you a thing that I
know!'</p>

<p>'I will put it quite plainly. Effie, am I the same man? I feel
transformed. What a difference it makes only to think that, perhaps,
after all one is not such a dreadful failure!' In fact, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
looked transformed. The trouble had gone out of him&mdash;out of his
face&mdash;out of his hair&mdash;out of his clothes&mdash;out of his attitude.
Armorel even fancied that his limp, day-before-yesterday's collar
had become white and starched again. That may have been mere
fancy, but joy certainly produces very strange effects.</p>

<p>'I would have sent an answer before,' he said, 'but it is so
unlucky for Effie. This great man&mdash;this critic&mdash;is the only editor
who would ever take her verses. And now, of course, he will be
offended, and will never take any more.'</p>

<p>'He shall not have any more,' said Effie, with red cheeks.</p>

<p>'Oh! But that would be horribly mean. Well, Archie, I will
begin by taking advice. I know a dramatic critic&mdash;his name is
Stephenson. I will ask him what you should do next, and I will
ask him about your verses, Effie, too&mdash;those verses which you are
always going to show me.'</p>

<p>'I tell her,' said her brother, 'that she will easily find another
editor. You would say so too, if you were to see her verses. I am
always telling her she ought to show them to you.'</p>

<p>The poet blushed. 'Some day, perhaps, when I am very
courageous.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;to-day.' Archie opened a drawer and took out a manuscript
book bound in limp brown leather. 'I will read you one,'
he said.</p>

<p>'Of course, you will say kind things,' said the poet. 'But you
cannot deceive me, Armorel. I shall tell by your eyes and by your
face if you really like my rhymes.'</p>

<p>'Well, I will read one, and I will lend you the volume, and
then you will see whether Effie hasn't got her gifts as well as anybody
else.'</p>

<p>He turned over the pages, selected a poem, and read it.
The lines showed, first of all, the command that comes of long
and constant practice; and next, they were sweet, simple, and
pure in tone.</p>

<p>'Strange!' said Armorel. 'I seem to have heard something
like them before&mdash;a phrase, perhaps. Where did I read only the
other day?... Never mind. But, Effie, this is not ordinary
girl's verse.'</p>

<p>'Oh! you really like it?'</p>

<p>'Of course I like it. But it is so strange&mdash;I seemed to know
the style. May I borrow the whole volume? I will be very careful
with it. Thank you. I will carry it home with me. And
now&mdash;I have thought of a plan. Listen, Archie. You know that
many young dramatists bring out their pieces first at a matinée.
Now, suppose that you read your piece, Archie, in my rooms in
the evening. Should you like to do so?'</p>

<p>'I read badly,' he said. 'Could Effie read or recite it?'</p>

<p>'The very thing. Bring your dolls along and arrange your
groups, while Effie recites. You will do that, Effie?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>'I will do anything that will help Archie.'</p>

<p>'Very well, then. We will get an evening fixed as soon as
possible. I fear we shall have to wait a week at least. I will get
my dramatic critic and a few more people, and we will have a
private performance of our own. And then we shall defy this
critic who said the piece was worthless&mdash;and then wanted to buy it
and to bring it out as his own. I could not have believed,' she
added, 'that there were two such impudent pretenders and liars
to be found in the whole of London.'</p>

<p>'Two?' asked Ellie, changing colour. 'There can be only
one.'</p>

<small>AN HONOURABLE PROPOSAL</small></h2>


<p>At the same time Mr. Alec Feilding, whose ears ought to have
been burning, was engaged in a serious conversation in his own
studio with Armorel's companion. The conversation took the form
of reproach. 'I expected,' he said&mdash;'I had a right to expect&mdash;greater
devotion&mdash;more attention to business. It was not for
play that you undertook the charge of this girl. How long have
you been with her? Three months? And no more influence with
her than when you began.'</p>

<p>'Not a bit more,' Mrs. Elstree replied. She had of course
taken the most comfortable chair by the fire. 'Not a bit, my dear
Alec. What is more, I never shall have any influence over her.
A society girl I could manage. I know what she wants, and
how she looks at things. With such a girl as Armorel I am powerless.'</p>

<p>'She is a woman, I suppose.' He occupied a commanding
position on his own hearthrug, towering above his visitor, but yet
he did not command her.</p>

<p>'Therefore, you think, open to flattery and artful wiles. She
is a woman, and yet, strange to say, not open to flattery.'</p>

<p>'Rubbish! It is because you are too stupid or too careless to
find out the weak point.'</p>

<p>'To return, Alec: I have failed. I have no influence at all
upon this girl. I have spent hours and hours in singing your
praise. I have enlarged upon the absolute necessity of giving you
a rest from business cares. I have proposed that she and I together&mdash;that
was the way I put it&mdash;should buy a share in the
paper, and that she should advance my half. Oh! I grew eloquent
on the glory that two women thus coming to the relief of a man
like yourself would achieve in after years. I tried to speak from
my heart, Alec.' The woman caught his hand, but he drew it
away. 'Oh! you deserve no help. You are hard-hearted, and
you are selfish: you have broken every promise you ever made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
me: you spend all that you have in selfish pleasures: you leave
me almost without assistance&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'When I have got you into the easiest and most luxurious berth
that can be imagined; when I have asked you for nothing but a
simple&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear Alec, but you see that an honest acknowledgment
would be worth all this goodness. Well, I say that I spoke from
my heart, because in spite of all I was proud of my man&mdash;mine,
yes, though Philippa still imagines, poor wretch!'</p>

<p>'Do leave my cousin's name out of it, will you, Zoe?' he said,
a little less roughly.</p>

<p>'I am proud of the man who is acknowledged to be the cleverest
man in London.' She got up and began to walk about the studio.
She stopped before the picture. 'Do you know, Alec&mdash;I am not a
critic, but I can feel a thing&mdash;that this is quite the best work you
have ever done. Oh! Those waves, they live and dance; and
those birds, they fly; and the air is so warm and soft!&mdash;you are a
great painter. Odd! your girl is curiously like Armorel. One
would fancy your model was Armorel at sixteen or so&mdash;a lovely
girl she must have been then, and a lovely woman she is now.'
Zoe left the picture and began to look at the papers on the table.
'What is this&mdash;the new story? Is it good?'</p>

<p>'To you, Zoe, I may confess that it is as good as anything I
have ever done.'</p>

<p>'You are really splendid, Alec! What is this?' She took up a
very neatly written page in his handwriting. 'Poetry?'</p>

<p>'Those are some verses for next week's journal. I think there
is no falling off there, Zoe.'</p>

<p>'Have you got another copy?'</p>

<p>'There is the copy that has gone to the printers'.'</p>

<p>'Then I will take this. It will do for a present&mdash;the autograph
original draft of the poem&mdash;or I may keep it.'</p>

<p>'Zoe, come back and sit down. We must talk seriously.'</p>

<p>She returned and took up her old position by the fire. 'As
seriously as you please. It means something disagreeable&mdash;something
to do with money. Let us get it over. To go back to what
we were saying, therefore. I cannot get you that money from
Armorel. And at the very word of money she refers one to her
lawyer. No confidence at all, as between friends who love each
other. That is the position, Alec.' She sat with her hands clasped
over her right knee.</p>

<p>'I must have some money,' he said.</p>

<p>'Then, as I have before remarked, Alec&mdash;make it.'</p>

<p>'If one cannot have money, Zoe, one may get credit, which is
sometimes just as good.'</p>

<p>'I cannot help you in getting credit.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you can. You can help me, Zoe, by keeping quite
quiet.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! I am always quiet. I have remained quiet for three
years and more, while you flirt with countesses and cousins. How
much more quiet do you wish me to remain? While you marry
them?'</p>

<p>'Not quite that, my child. But next door to it. While I get
engaged to one of them&mdash;to one who has money.'</p>

<p>'Not&mdash;Philippa.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;I told you before. What the devil is the good of harping
on Philippa? You see, if I can let it be understood that I am
going to marry an heiress, the difficulties will be tided over.
Therefore I shall get engaged to your charge&mdash;Armorel Rosevean.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' Zoe received this proposition with coldness. 'This is
a charming thing for me to sanction, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'It will do you no harm.'</p>

<p>'I have certainly endured things as bad.'</p>

<p>'You see, Zoe, one could always break off the thing when the
time came.'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>'And you would know all the time that it was a mere pretence.'</p>

<p>'I should certainly know that.'</p>

<p>'Well; is there any other observation?'</p>

<p>'You would make it an open engagement&mdash;go about with her&mdash;have
it publicly known?'</p>

<p>'Of course. The whole point is publicity. I must be known
to be engaged to an heiress.'</p>

<p>'And it would last&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'As long as might prove necessary. One could find an excuse
at any time for breaking it off.'</p>

<p>'Or I could.'</p>

<p>'Just so. It really amounts to nothing at all.'</p>

<p>'To nothing at all!' Zoe neither raised her voice nor her eyes.
'Here is a man who proposes to pretend love and to win a girl's
affections, when he can never marry her. He also proposes to
throw her over, as soon as she has served his purpose. It is nothing
at all, of course! Alec, you are really a wonderful man!'</p>

<p>'Nonsense! The thing is done every day.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;not every day. If you are the cleverest man in London,
you are also the most heartless.'</p>

<p>'You know that you can say what you please,' he replied, without
any outward sign of annoyance. 'Even heroics.'</p>

<p>'But,' she said, nursing her knee and swinging backwards and
forwards, 'we have forgotten one thing&mdash;the most important thing
of all, in fact. My poor boy, there is no more chance of your
being engaged to Armorel than of your entering into the Kingdom
of Heaven.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Other girls you might catch: you are tall and big and handsome;
and you have the reputation of being so very, very clever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Most girls would be carried away. But not Armorel. She is not
subdued by bigness in men, and she doesn't especially care for a
clever man. She is actually so old-fashioned&mdash;think of it!&mdash;that
she wants&mdash;character.'</p>

<p>'Well! What objection would that raise, I should like to know?'</p>

<p>Zoe laughed softly and sweetly.</p>

<p>'Don't you see, dear Alec? Oh! But you must let Armorel
explain to you.'</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV_2" id="CHAPTER_XV_2"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>NOT TWO MEN, BUT ONE</small></h2>


<p>Great is the power of coincidence. Things have got a habit of
happening just when they are most likely to be useful. It is not
on the stage alone that the long-lost uncle turns up, or the long-missing
will is found in the cupboard. And you cannot invent for
fiction anything half so strange as the daily coincidence of common
life. A tolerably long experience of the common life has convinced
me of this great truth. Therefore, the coincidence which happened
to Armorel on the very day when the young dramatist unfolded his
griefs will not, by wise men, be thought at all strange.</p>

<p>It was in the evening. She was sitting with her companion,
thinking over Archie and his play. Was it really good? Was it
good enough to hold the stage, and to command the attention of
the audience? To her it seemed a singularly beautiful, poetical,
and romantic piece. But Armorel was of a lowly and humble mind.
She knew that she had no experience in things dramatic. Had it
been a picture, now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried her companion, suddenly starting upright in the
cushioned chair where she was lying apparently asleep, 'I had
almost forgotten. My dear, I have got a present for you.'</p>

<p>'From yourself, Zoe?'</p>

<p>'Yes; from myself. It is a present which cost me nothing,
but is worth a good deal. The making of it cost nobody anything.
Yet it is a very precious thing. The material of which it is made
is worth nothing. Yet the thing is worth anything you please.'</p>

<p>'It must be a picture, then.'</p>

<p>'It is a Work of Art, but not a picture. Guess again.'</p>

<p>'No; I will not guess any more. May I have it without guessing?'</p>

<p>Zoe held in her hands a small roll of blue paper. This she now
opened, and gazed at the writing upon it with idolatry: but it
hardly carried conviction with it&mdash;perhaps it was a little overdone.</p>

<p>'Least imaginative of girls,' she said. It pleased her to consider
Armorel's refusal to join in that little scheme of hers as proving
a lack of imagination. 'I have brought you, though you do
not deserve it, what any other girl in London would give&mdash;would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
give&mdash;a dance, perhaps, to obtain, and you shall have it for
nothing.'</p>

<p>'I want to hear what it is.'</p>

<p>'It is nothing less, Armorel, nothing less&mdash;I got it to-day from
the table in his studio&mdash;than an autograph: it is the copy used by
the printers&mdash;an autograph poem of Alec's! An autograph poem,
as yet unpublished.'</p>

<p>'Is that all?' replied the least imaginative of girls. 'You
must not give it to me, really. You will value it far more than I
shall. Besides, I suppose it is to be published some day.'</p>

<p>'But the original manuscript&mdash;the autograph poem, dear child!
Don't you know the value of such a thing? Take it. You shall
be enriched in spite of yourself. Take it and put it aside somewhere
in your desk, in some safe place. Heavens! if one had the
autograph of a poem of Byron, for example!'</p>

<p>'Mr. Feilding is not Byron,' said Armorel, coldly. 'He may
write pretty feminine verses, but he is not Byron. Thank you,
however. I will take it, and I will keep it and value it because
you think it valuable. I do not suppose the autograph verses of
small poets are worth keeping; but still&mdash;as you value it' ...</p>

<p>This was very ungracious and ungrateful. But she was really
tired of Mr. Feilding's praises, and after the discovery of the
pictures, and after the strange story she had heard only that morning&mdash;no;
she wanted to hear no more, for the present, of the
praises of this man&mdash;the cleverest man in London!</p>

<p>However, she unrolled the paper, and began to read the contents,
at first carelessly. Then, 'Oh! what is this?' she cried.</p>

<p>'What is what?' asked Mrs. Elstree.</p>

<p>'This is a copy.'</p>

<p>They were the same words as she had used concerning the
pictures. She remembered this, and a strange suspicion seized
her. 'A copy,' she repeated, wondering.</p>

<p>'A copy? Not at all. They are the verses which are to appear
in the next number of the journal&mdash;or the number after next.
Alec's own verses, of course. Sweetly pretty, I think: what makes
you say that they are copied?'</p>

<p>'I thought that I had seen them&mdash;something like them&mdash;somewhere
before.' She went on reading. As she read she remembered
the lines more clearly.</p>

<p>'What is the matter, Armorel?' asked Zoe. 'What makes
you look so fierce? Heaven help your husband when you look
like that!'</p>

<p>'Did I look fierce? It must have been something that I remembered.
Yes&mdash;that was it.'</p>

<p>'May I read the verses again?' Zoe read them, suspiciously.
There was something in them which had startled Armorel. What
was it? She could see nothing to account for this emotion. Certainly
she was not fond of poetry, and failed to appreciate the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
turns and subtle tones, the felicitous phrase and the unexpected
thought with which the poet delights his readers. In this little
poem she could find nothing but a few jingling rhymes. Why
should Armorel behave so strangely?</p>

<p>'What is it, my dear?' she asked again.</p>

<p>'Something I remembered&mdash;nothing of any importance.'</p>

<p>'Armorel, has Alec said anything to you? Has he&mdash;has he
wanted to make love to you? Has he offended you by speaking?'</p>

<p>'No. There has been no question of love-making between us,
and there never will be.'</p>

<p>'One cannot say.' Zoe looked at the matter from experience.
'One can never say. Men are strange creatures; and Alec
certainly thinks a great deal of you.'</p>

<p>'I cannot imagine his making love&mdash;any more than I can
imagine his painting a picture or writing a poem. Perhaps he
would make love as he paints.'</p>

<p>'Well, he paints very well.'</p>

<p>'Very well indeed, I dare say.' She got up. 'I am going to
leave you to-night, Zoe. I want to go to my own room. I have
things to write. You don't mind?'</p>

<p>'My dear child, mind! Of course, one would rather have your
company. But since you must leave me'&mdash;she sank back in her
chair with a sigh. 'Give me that book, dear&mdash;if you please&mdash;the
French novel. When one has been married one can read French
novels without trying to conceal the fact. They are mostly wicked,
and sometimes witty. Not always. Good-night, dear. I shall
not expect you back this evening.'</p>

<p>Armorel, in her own room, opened the manuscript book of
poems which Archie had given her, and found&mdash;the very last of
all&mdash;the lines which she had remembered. She laid the precious
autograph beside Effie's poem. Word for word&mdash;comma for
comma&mdash;they were exactly the same. There was not the slightest
difference. And again Armorel thought of the two pictures.</p>

<p>Then she thought of the little dainty volume in white parchment
containing the Second Series of 'Voice and Echo, by Alec
Feilding.' She had tossed it aside, impatient with the man, when
Zoe gave it to her. Now she looked for it, and found it after a
little search. She opened it side by side with Effie's manuscript
book. Presently she found the page in Effie's book which corresponded
with the first page of the printed volume. There were
about thirty or forty poems in the little book: in the manuscript
book there were double that number; but the same poems followed
each other one after the other in the same order, and without the
difference of a single word, both in book and manuscript.</p>

<p>This discovery justifies my remarks about the common coincidences
of daily life.</p>

<p>Again Armorel remembered that Zoe possessed another volume&mdash;the
First Series of 'Voice and Echo, by Alec Feilding.' It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
lying&mdash;she had seen it in the afternoon&mdash;in the drawing-room.
She went in search of it, and returned without waking her companion,
who had apparently fallen asleep over her novel.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Mrs. Elstree was not sleeping. She was
broad awake, but she was curious. She desired to know what it
all meant: why Armorel was suddenly struck with hardness, why
her cheek burned, and her eyes flashed; and what she wanted in
the drawing-room. She perceived that Armorel had come in
search of Alec's first volume of verse. Oh! Alec's first volume of
verse. Now&mdash;what might Armorel want with that book?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At the end of March it is light at about half-past five. Everybody
is then in their soundest sleep. But at that hour Mrs.
Elstree came softly out of her bedroom, wrapped in a dressing-gown,
her feet in soft slippers of white wool, and looked at the
books and papers on the table in Armorel's room. There was a
manuscript volume of verse, professing to be by one Effie Wilmot.
There were also two printed little volumes, bound in white-and-gold,
containing verses by one Alec Feilding. Strange and wonderful!
The verses in both books were exactly the same! Mrs.
Elstree returned to bed, thoughtful.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Armorel, for her part, when she returned to her own room,
compared the first series of poems, as she had compared the second,
with the manuscript book. And the first series, too, word for
word, was the same as the earlier poems in the book.</p>

<p>'Good heavens!' cried Armorel. 'The man steals his verses,
as he steals his pictures! Poor Effie! She is as bad as Roland!'</p>

<p>This was Thought the First. One has already seen how the
three Thoughts treated her before. This time it was just the
same. Thought the Second came next, and began to argue. A
very capable logician is Thought the Second, once distinguished
for what Oxford men call Science. If, said Thought the Second,
the manuscript and the volumes agree, it seems to show that Effie
has copied the latter into her own book, and now tries to pass the
poems off as her own. Such things have been done. If this was
the case&mdash;and why not?&mdash;Effie would be, indeed, a girl full of
deceit and desperately wicked. But then, how came Effie to have
in her volume a poem hitherto unpublished, which was lying on
Mr. Feilding's table? Yet, surely, it was quite as probable that the
girl should deceive her as that the man should deceive the world.</p>

<p>Next. Thought the Third. This sage remarked calmly, 'The
man is full of villany. He has deceived the world in the matter of
the pictures. Why not also in the matter of the poems? But let
us consider the character of the verses. Take internal evidence.'
Then Armorel read the whole series right through in the two little
printed volumes. Oh! They were feminine. Only a woman could
write these lines. Womanhood breathed in every one. Now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the key was supplied, she understood. She recognised the voice,
eager, passionate, of her friend.</p>

<p>'They are all Effie's!' she cried again; 'all&mdash;all. The man
has stolen his verses as well as his pictures.'</p>

<p>This discovery, when she had quite made up her mind that it
was as true as the former, entirely fell in with all that Effie had
told her concerning herself. She had sold her poems all to one
editor&mdash;he was the only editor who would ever take them&mdash;and
now she was afraid that he would take no more. Why?&mdash;why?&mdash;because&mdash;oh,
now she understood all&mdash;because he wanted to be a
dramatist in the same way that he was a painter and a poet, and
neither Archie nor his sister would consent! 'Yes,' she said, 'he
is, indeed, the cleverest man in London.'</p>

<p>Before she went to bed that night she had devised a little
plan&mdash;quite an ingenious clever little plan. You shall hear what
it was, and how it came off.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI_2" id="CHAPTER_XVI_2"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE PLAY AND THE COMEDY</small></h2>


<p>Armorel arranged for the reading of the play one evening four or
five days later. It was a short notice, but she secured the people
whom she wanted most, and trusted to chance for the others. She
occupied herself in the interval in arranging the details and leading
situations for a little comedy drama of her own&mdash;a play of some
melodramatic force, in which, as in 'Hamlet,' a certain guilty
person was to discover by a kind of dumb show that his guilt was
known to her. It was to be a comedy which no one, except herself,
was to understand. You shall see, directly, what an extremely
clever little comedy it was, and how effective to the person principally
concerned. She said nothing at all about this comedy even
to Effie. As for words, there were none. They were left to the
principal character. This is, indeed, the ancient and original
drama. The situations were, at the outset, devised beforehand.
The actors filled in the dialogue. This form of drama is still kept
up, and with vigour. When the schoolboy sets the booby-trap, or
sews up the shirt-sleeves, or greases the side-walk&mdash;if that old
situation is still remembered&mdash;or practises any other kindly and
mirthful sally, the victim supplies the words. The confidence
trick in all its branches is another form of the primitive drama,
and this evening's performance with reference to a certain person
was only another example. You will hear, presently, what admirable
dialogue was elicited by Armorel's situations.</p>

<p>By half-past eight she had completed the mounting of her
piece. First, for the reading of the play she placed a table at the side
of the room, with a space at the back sufficient for a chair, or for
a person to sit. A reading-lamp, with one of those silver cowls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that throw the whole light upon the table, stood at either end,
illuminating a small space in the middle. This was for the manipulation
of the dolls. For, though the people had been asked to
come for a reading, Armorel had determined to try the experiment
of a recitation, accompanied by the presentment of those puppets
which Effie had dressed with such care, and her brother manipulated
so deftly. Needless to say that more than one rehearsal had
been held. In front of the table she placed a semicircle of chairs
for some of her audience. At one side of the table was the piano:
a music-stand, with a violin case, gave promise of an overture.
Between the music-stand and the table was room for a person to
stand, and on the table a water-decanter and a glass showed that
this was the place for the reciter. On the other side of the table,
in the corner of the room, stood an easel, and on it a picture, with
curtains arranged so that they could fall over and cover it up. The
picture was lighted up by two lamps. The room had no other
lights in it at all, so that, if these two lamps were lowered or extinguished,
the only light would be that thrown by the reading-lamps
upon the table. As for the picture, it was as yet unfinished, but
nearly finished. Of course it was Roland Lee's new picture. This
evening, indeed, which professed to be the simple reading of a new
play by a new writer, included a great deal more: it included, in
fact, Roland's return to the arena he had deserted, and, as you
shall see, the stepping upon the stage of both the twins, brother
and sister. When one adds that Mr. Alec Feilding would be one
of the company, you understand, dear reader, the nature of
Armorel's comedy, and the kind of situation devised and prepared
by that artful and vindictive young lady.</p>

<p>'How long will it take, dear?' asked Mrs. Elstree, wearily
contemplating these preparations.</p>

<p>'I should say that the play will take an hour and a half or two
hours to recite. Then there will be a little music between the acts.
I dare say it will last two hours and a half.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that will bring us to half-past eleven at least! And then
it will be too late for anything else.'</p>

<p>'We don't want anything else to-night.'</p>

<p>'No, dear. The play will be quite enough for us. I wish it
was over. I am so constituted, Armorel, that I cannot see the
least use in going out of my way to help anybody. If you succeed
in helping people to climb up, they only trample on you as soon as
they get the chance. If you fail, they are a burden upon you for
life. These two Wilmot people, for instance: what are you going
to do with them when you have read their play and stuff? You
can't get a manager to play it any the more for having it read. The
two are no further advanced.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I shall have made the young man known. He will be
introduced. Mr. Stephenson promised to bring some critics with
him, and you have asked Mr. Feilding to do the same. An introduction&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the creation of some personal interest&mdash;may be
to Archie of the greatest advantage.'</p>

<p>'Then he will rise by your help, and he will proceed to
trample upon you. That is, if the brother is like the sister. If
ever I saw "trampler" written plain on any woman's face, it is
written on the great square block of bone that Effie Wilmot calls
a forehead.'</p>

<p>'They may trample on me if they please,' Armorel replied,
smiling.</p>

<p>The tramplers were naturally the first to arrive. They were
both pale, and they trembled, especially the one who was not going
to speak. He came in, limping on his crutches, and looked around
with terror at the preparations. One does not realise before the
night comes what a serious thing is a first appearance in public.
Besides, the strong light on the table, the expectant chairs, the arrangement
of everything, presented an aspect at once critical and
threatening. The manuscript play and the box of puppets were in
readiness.</p>

<p>'Now, Archie,' said Armorel, 'it is not yet nine o'clock. You
shall have a cup of coffee to steady your nerves. So shall you,
Effie. After that we will settle ourselves.' She talked about
other things to distract their thoughts. 'See, Effie, that is Roland
Lee's new picture. It is not yet finished. The central figure is
myself. You see, it is as yet only sketched in. I am going to sit
for him, but he has caught a good likeness, has he not? It will be
a lovely picture when it is completed, and I am going to give him
permission to flatter me as much as ever he pleases. The scene is
among the outer rocks of Scilly. We will go there some day and
sail about the Western Islands, and I will show you Camber Rock
and the Channel, and Castle Bryher and Menovawr and Maiden
Bower, and all the lovely places where I lived till I was sixteen
years of age. Are you in good voice to-night, Effie?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. I hope so.'</p>

<p>'She has eaten nothing all day,' said Archie.</p>

<p>'You are not really frightened, are you, Effie?' The girl was
white with nervousness. 'A little excited and anxious. Will
you have another cup of coffee? A little jelly? Remember
I shall be close beside you, with the play in my hand, to prompt.
I like your dress. You look very well in white, dear.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Armorel, I am horribly frightened. If I should break
down, Archie's chance will be ruined. And if I recite it badly
I shall spoil the play.'</p>

<p>'You will not break down, dear; you will think of nothing but
the play. You will forget the people. Besides, it will be so dark
that you will hardly see them.'</p>

<p>'I will try my best. Perhaps when I begin&mdash;Oh! for Archie's
sake, I would stand up on the stage at the theatre and speak before
all the people! And yet&mdash;&mdash;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>'She had no sleep last night,' said her brother. 'I think,
after all, I had better read it. Only I read so badly.'</p>

<p>Armorel's face fell. She had thought so much of the reciting.
Then Mrs. Elstree came to the rescue.</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' she said. 'You three people are making yourselves
so nervous that you will most certainly break down. Now, Mr.
Wilmot, go into your own place. Set out your dolls. Here's
your cardboard back scene.' She arranged it while Archie got
himself and his crutches into the chair behind, and began to take
the dolls out of their box. 'So. Now don't speak to your sister.
You will only make her worse. And as for you, Effie, if you break
down now you will be a most disgraceful coward. With your
brother's future, perhaps, dependent on your courage. For
shame! Pull yourself together!' Effie, thus rudely stimulated,
and by a person she disliked greatly, lost her limpness and stood
upright. Her face also put on a little colour, and her lips stiffened.
The tonic worked, in fact. Then Zoe went on. 'Now,' she said,
'take up your position here. How are you going to stand? Fold
your hands so. That is a very good attitude to begin with.
Of course, you understand nothing of gesture. Don't try it.
Change your hands a little&mdash;so&mdash;front&mdash;right&mdash;left&mdash;like that.
And don't&mdash;don't&mdash;don't hold your head like that, facing the
crowd. Hold it up&mdash;like this. Look at the corner of that
cornice&mdash;straight up. Oh! you will lower your head as you go
on. But, to begin with, and at the opening of each act, look
up to that corner. Remember, if you break down&mdash;&mdash;' She held
up a forefinger, threatening, admonitory, and left her standing
in position. 'You will do now,' she said.</p>

<p>'Besides,' said Armorel, 'no one will look at you. They will
all be looking at Archie's actors.'</p>

<p>The dramatist, relegated to the humble position of fantoccini-man,
would be also in complete shade behind the table. He
would not be seen, whatever emotion of anxiety he should feel.
And for dexterity of manipulation with his puppets he could vie
even with the firm of Codlin and Short.</p>

<p>The noise of cups and saucers in the dining-room proclaimed
the arrival of guests. The first to come was Roland Lee, still a
little shy, as Alexander Selkirk might have been, or Philip Quarles,
or Mr. Penrose, on his return to civilised society. He looked
about the room. Mrs. Elstree&mdash;looking resigned&mdash;and Armorel,
standing by the fire, and the two performers. Nobody else. And,
in a place of honour, his unfinished picture.</p>

<p>'It looks very well, doesn't it?' said Armorel. 'I wish it was
a little more complete. But it will do to show.'</p>

<p>'Are you quite sure it is wise?'</p>

<p>'Quite sure. The sooner you show everybody what you can
do the better.'</p>

<p>'I have found a new studio,' he told her in low tones. 'I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
moved in to-day. It is among the old lot of men that I used to
know a little. I have gone back to them just as if I had only been
gone for a day. I don't find that they have got on very much.
Perhaps they spend too much time smoking pipes and cigarettes
and talking. They chaff me, but with respect, because, I believe,
they think I have been staying in a lunatic asylum. Respect, you
know, is due to madmen and to old men.'</p>

<p>'I hope it is the kind of studio you want.'</p>

<p>'It will do. I am anxious to begin your sittings. When can
you come?'</p>

<p>'Any day you please. To-morrow. The next day. I can
begin at once.'</p>

<p>Then came a small party of men&mdash;journalists and critics&mdash;captured
by Dick Stephenson at the club, and bribed to come
by the promise of an introduction to the beautiful Miss Armorel
Rosevean. I do not think they expected much joy from the
amateur reading of an unacted piece. It is melancholy, indeed,
to consider that though the preliminary and tentative performance
of the unacted play&mdash;long prayed for&mdash;has been at last
established, the promised appearance of the great dramatist has
not yet come off&mdash;nay, the theatrical critic weeps, swears, and
growls at the mention of a matinée, and when he is requested
to attend one passes it on if he can to his younger brother in
the calling. And yet such great treasures were expected of the
matinée! However, they agreed to come and listen on this
occasion. It shall be put down to their credit as a Samaritan deed.</p>

<p>'Dick Stephenson,' said Armorel, with an assumption of old
friendship which filled him with pride, 'I hope you are come here
to-night in a really serious frame of mind&mdash;you and your friends.'</p>

<p>'We are always serious.'</p>

<p>'I mean that you are going to hear an ambitious piece of work.
All I ask of you is to listen seriously, and to remember that it
is really the work of a man who aims at the very highest.'</p>

<p>'Will he reach the very highest?'</p>

<p>'I do not know. But I am quite certain that there are very
few artists, in any branch, who dare to aim high. Listen, and
try to understand what the poet has attempted&mdash;what has been
in his mind. Promise me this.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, I will promise you so much.'</p>

<p>'Thank you. It was for this that I asked you to-night. And
see&mdash;here is your old friend Roland Lee.' The two young men
shook hands rather sheepishly&mdash;the one because he had been an
Ass&mdash;a long-eared Ass; and the other, because he was not guiltless
of letting his friend slip out of his hands without a remonstrance
and so away into paths unknown. 'I hear,' said Armorel,
with her beautiful seriousness, 'that you two have suffered yourselves
to drift apart of late. I hope that will be all over now.
Oh! you must never give up the early friendships. Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
seen Roland's new picture? He has lent it to me for this evening.
Come and look at it.'</p>

<p>'Why,' cried one of the men, 'it is an unfinished picture of
Alec Feilding's!'</p>

<p>Roland turned hot and red.</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Armorel. 'This is a sketch made in the isles
of Scilly and in my presence, five years ago. As for the figure,
you see it is not yet completed. I am the model. You remember
Scilly, Dick Stephenson? To be sure, you were not with us when
we used to go sailing about among the rocks.'</p>

<p>'I have reason to remember Scilly, seeing that you saved my
life there, and Roland's too. But the picture is curiously in
Feilding's style. Only it seems to me better than any of his.
Old man'&mdash;he laid his hand on Roland's shoulder: it was the
renewal of the ancient friendship&mdash;'old man, you've done the trick
at last.'</p>

<p>Philippa came next, with her father and two or three girls.
They, in their turn, called out upon the striking similarity in
style. A few more people came, and it was a quarter past nine.
But the man for whom Armorel had especially arranged her
little comedy did not come. He was late. Perhaps he would not
come at all.</p>

<p>'We must wait no longer,' said Armorel. 'Will everybody
please to sit down?'</p>

<p>Philippa placed herself at the piano. Armorel took out her
violin and tuned it. First, however, she made a little speech.</p>

<p>'I have asked you,' she said, 'to come this evening in
order to hear a play read. It is a play written by a young
gentleman in whom some of us take the deepest interest. I
hope greatly that it will succeed. But we want your judgment
and opinion as well as our own. The play belongs to all time
and to no time. The scene is laid in Italy, and in the sixteenth
century; but it might as well have been laid in London and in
the nineteenth&mdash;only that we are more self-governed than a
dramatist likes, and we conceal our emotions. It is a play of
romance and of human passion. I entreat you to consider it
seriously&mdash;as seriously as the author himself considers it. We
have arranged for you a list of the dramatis personæ, with a little
scenario of each act&mdash;there are three&mdash;and we think that if,
instead of hearing it read, we have it recited, while the author
himself plays the piece before us by puppets on this little stage, we
shall get a clearer idea of the dramatic merits of the piece.'</p>

<p>This speech done, everybody took up the little book of the play
and began to read the scenario, while Armorel played an overture
with Philippa.</p>

<p>She played a Hungarian piece, one of the things that are now
played everywhere&mdash;a quite short piece.</p>

<p>When it was finished, Roland lowered the lamps beside his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
picture, and covered them with crimson shades. Then there was
no other light in the room but that from the two reading-lamps on
the table. Just before the lamps were lowered Mr. Alec Feilding
arrived, with half a dozen men whom he had brought with him.
She saw his startled face as he caught sight of the picture as the
lights were lowered. In the twilight she could still distinguish his face
among the men who stood behind the chairs. And she watched
him. Then Effie, who had not seen the latest arrival, took her
place, and the play began.</p>

<p>The effect was new and very curious. The people saw a girl
standing up beside the table&mdash;only the shadow of a girl&mdash;a ghostly
figure in white&mdash;the spectre of a white face&mdash;two bright eyes
flashing in the dim light. And they heard her voice, a rich, low
contralto, beginning to recite the play.</p>

<p>It is not the nervous creature who breaks down. He may
generally be trusted. He lies awake for whole nights before the
time arrives: he reaches the spot weak-kneed, trembling, and
pale; but when the hour strikes he braces himself, stands up, and
goes through with it. Effie had been partly pulled together, it is
true, by the rough exhortation of Mrs. Elstree, but some credit
must be given to her own resolution. She began with a little
hesitation, fearing that she should forget the words. Then they
came back to her: she saw them written plainly before her eyes
in that friendly corner of the cornice: she hesitated no longer:
in full and flowing flood she poured forth the dialogue, helped to
right modulation by the strength of her own feeling and her belief
in the beauty and the splendour of the drama. Armorel meantime
watched her man. He had seen the picture. Now he recognised
the play, and he knew the reciter. As he stood at the back, tall
above the rest, she saw his face change from astonishment
gradually to dismay. It was rather a wooden face, but it passed
plainly and successively through the phases of doubt and certainty
to that of dismay. Yes; dismay was written on that face, with
discomfiture and suspicion. In a more demonstrative age he
would have sat gnawing his nails: every wicked man, overtaken
by the consequence of his own wickedness, used formerly to gnaw
his nails. On the stage of the last century he would have turned
upon his persecutors with a 'Death and confusion!' before he
banged off the scene. We no longer use those fine old phrases.
On the modern stage he would stand with straightened arms and
bowed head, while the rest of the company pointed fingers of scorn
at him, crushed but defiant. In Armorel's drawing-room he stood
quiet and motionless, trying to collect himself. He saw, first of
all, Roland Lee's new picture in the corner; he saw Roland Lee
himself, no longer the negligent, despairing sloven, but once more
a gentleman to outer view, and in his right mind. Next, he
observed that Effie, his own poet, was reciting the play; and,
thirdly, that the play was that for which he had himself made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a bid. Thus all three&mdash;painter, poet, and dramatist&mdash;were friends
of this girl Armorel; and they had all three, he knew quite well,
slipped clean out of his hands for ever, and were lost to him; and
all three, he suspected, had already related to each other the
history of his doings and dealings with themselves. Therefore,
while the play proceeded, his heart sank low&mdash;lower&mdash;lower.</p>

<p>There were three acts. When the first was finished Armorel
stood up again and, with Philippa, played another little piece, but
not long. And so between the second and the third.</p>

<p>Watching the people, Armorel became aware that the play had
gripped them, and held them fast. No one moved. The little
space upon the table between the two lamps, where the puppets
stood before the painted screen of cardboard, became a scene
richly mounted: it was a garden, or a dancing-hall, or an arbour,
or a library, just as those little books told them, and the puppets
were men and women. We want so little of mounting to fire the
imagination, if only the poet has the strength to seize it and
to hold it by his words. Nothing, in this case, but a modulated
voice reciting a dramatic poem, and, to help it out, a dozen
dressed dolls, six or seven inches high, standing stiffly on a little
stage. Yet, even when passion was at its highest, in the great
scene of the third act, they were not ridiculous. Nobody laughed
at the dolls. That was because the showman knew their capabilities.
When they stood in their place, they indicated the nature
of the situation and explained the words. Had he tried to make
them act, he would have spoiled the whole. They made a series
of groups&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableaux vivants</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poses plastiques</i>&mdash;constantly changed
by the deft hands of the showman, finding relief in this
occupation for the anxiety in his soul. For he, less fortunate
than Effie, who had grasped the cheering truth, could not read
in the circle of still faces before him their rapt and magnetised
condition.</p>

<p>And now the end of the third act was neared. The reciter
rose to the concluding situation. Her voice, firm and clear, rang
out in the dim light. The younger girls in the audience caught each
other's hands. The 'lines' were good lines, strong and nervous,
rapid and yet intense, equal to the strength and intensity of the
situation.</p>

<p>At last the play was finished.</p>

<p>'Effie!' Armorel caught her in her arms, 'you have done
splendidly!'</p>

<p>But the girl drew back. The honours of the evening were not
for her, but for her brother: she stood aside.</p>

<p>Armorel took the cowls from the reading-lamps, and the room
returned to light. Then the people began all to press round the
dramatist and to shake hands solemnly with him, to murmur, to
assure, to congratulate, and to prophesy. And the loud voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Mr. Alec Feilding arose as he stepped forward among the first and
grasped the young man's hand.</p>

<p>'Archie!' he said with astounding friendliness, 'this is better
than I expected. Let me congratulate you! I have had the
privilege,' he explained to the multitude, 'of hearing this play&mdash;at
least, a part of it&mdash;already. I told you, my dear boy, that your
situations were splendid, but your dialogue wanted pulling together
in parts. You have attended to my advice. I am glad of it. The
result promises to be a splendid success. What say you?' He
turned to a very well-known dramatic critic whom he had brought
with him.</p>

<p>'If you can get the proper man to play the leading part,' he
replied more quietly, 'the play seems to me full of promise.
Frankly, Mr. Wilmot, I think you have written a most poetical
and most romantic piece. It is valuable, not only for itself, but
for the promise it contains.'</p>

<p>'For its promise,' repeated Alec Feilding blandly, 'as I told
you, my dear boy, for its promise&mdash;its admirable promise. I shall
not rest now until this play is produced&mdash;either at the Lyceum or
at the Haymarket. Once more.' Again he grasped Archie by the
hand. Then another and another followed. It was not until the
next day the dramatist recovered presence of mind enough to
remember that Mr. Feilding had not given him any advice: that
he had not said it was a work of promise: that he had offered to
buy it for fifty pounds and bring it out as his own, with his own
name put to it: and that no alteration of any kind had been made
in it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When Mr. Alec Feilding stepped back, he perceived that some
one had turned up the lamps beside the picture. He was a man
of great presence of mind and resource. He instantly stepped
over to the picture and began to examine it curiously. Armorel
followed him.</p>

<p>'This is by my old friend Mr. Roland Lee,' she said. 'Do you
know him? Let me introduce him to you.' The men bowed
distantly as those who, having met for the first time in a crowd,
see no reason for desiring to meet each other again. That they
should so meet, with such an assumption of never having met
before, struck Armorel with admiration.</p>

<p>'The picture is a good deal in your own style, Feilding,' said
one of the critics.</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' replied the successful painter in that style,
briefly.</p>

<p>'It is taken from a sketch,' Armorel explained, 'made by
Mr. Lee while he was staying at the same spot as myself. He
made a great number at the time&mdash;which is now five years ago.'</p>

<p>Mr. Alec Feilding heard this statement with outward composure.
Inwardly he was raging.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is, in fact, exactly in your style,' said the same critic. 'One
would say that it was a copy of one of your pictures.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' he replied again.</p>

<p>'If,' said Roland, 'Mr. Feilding sends another picture in the
same style for exhibition this year, I hope that the similarity of
style may be tested by their hanging side by side.'</p>

<p>'Shall you send anything this year&mdash;in the same style?' asked
Armorel.</p>

<p>'I hardly know. I have not decided.'</p>

<p>The critic looked at the picture more closely. 'Strange!' he
murmured. 'One would swear ... the same style&mdash;so individual&mdash;and
belonging to two different men!'</p>

<p>Then Roland covered his picture over with the curtain. There
had been enough said.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Armorel, 'after our emotions and our fatigues of
the play, we are exhausted. There is supper in the next room.
Before we go in I want to sing you a song. I am not a singer, you
know, and you must only expect simple warbling. But I want you
to like the song.'</p>

<p>She sat down to the piano and played a few bars of introduction.
Then she sang the first verse&mdash;it was Effie's latest song, that which
Mr. Feilding had accepted but not yet published.</p>

<p>He heard and recognised. This third blow finished him. He
sat down on the nearest chair, speechless. Mrs. Elstree watched
him, wondering what was the matter with him. For he was in a
speechless rage. Lucky for him that it was speechless, because for
the moment he was beside himself, and might have said anything.</p>

<p>'That is the first verse,' said Armorel. 'I have set it to an old
French air which I found in a book. The words seem written for
the music. There are two more verses.'</p>

<p>She sang them through. Her voice was pleasing though not
strong: she sang sweetly and with feeling, just as she had sung
in the old days on the shores of Samson, to the accompaniment of
the waves lapping along the white sands, and she watched the man
whom she had been torturing the whole evening through. Would
not even this rouse him to some word or deed which might proclaim
him a pretender and an impostor discovered? She knew,
you see, that the lines were actually in type ready to appear as
another poem by the Editor. She finished and rose. 'Do you
like the song, Philippa?' she said. 'I have even had it printed
and set to music. Anybody that pleases may carry away a copy.
I hope everybody will, and keep it in remembrance of this evening.
For the words are written by Miss Effie Wilmot, who has recited
so beautifully her brother's play. We will share the honours of
the evening between them. Archie, will you give me your arm?
Roland'&mdash;in her excitement she called him by his Christian name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which caused a little surprise&mdash;'will you take Effie? Do you like
the words, Mr. Feilding?'</p>

<p>'Very much indeed. I had seen them before you, I think.'</p>

<p>'Yes? Then you recognised them. You have seen other
poems by the same hand, I believe?'</p>

<p>'Good-night, Miss Rosevean. I have had a delightful evening.'
He retired without any supper. On his way out, he passed Effie.
'You should have trusted me,' he whispered hoarsely. 'I
expected, at least, common confidence. You will find that I
have kept my promise&mdash;and you have broken yours.' He
passed on, and disappeared. Then they trooped in to the dining-room,
where they found spread that kind of midnight refection
which is dear to the hearts of those who are yet young enough to
love champagne and chicken. And after supper they went back to
the drawing-room and danced. Mrs. Elstree played to them&mdash;nobody
could play a waltz better. Roland danced with Armorel.
'You make me believe,' he said, at the end of the waltz, 'that I
am really back again.'</p>

<p>'Of course you are back again.'</p>

<p>Then Armorel danced with the critics, and talked about the
play; and they all promised to go to great actors and speak about
this wonderful drama. And so all went away at last, and all to
bed, well content.</p>

<p>'But,' said Zoe, when the last was gone, 'what was the matter
with Alec? Why did he look so glum? What made him in such
an awful rage? He can get into a blind rage, Armorel&mdash;blind and
speechless. As for that, I would not give a button for a man who
could not. But what was the matter with him?'</p>

<p>'Was he in a rage? Perhaps he wished that he had written
the play himself. Such a clever man as that would be sorry,
perhaps, that anything good was written, except by himself.'</p>

<p>Mr. Alec Feilding rushed down the stairs and into the street.
He hailed a cab, and jumped into it.</p>

<p>'Fleet Street! Quick!'</p>

<p>His printers, he knew, had work which kept them at work on
Thursday nights till long past midnight. It was not too late to
make a correction. His paper would be printed in the morning,
and ready for issue by five o'clock in the afternoon. In fact, Effie
received a note from him on Saturday morning:&mdash;</p>

<p>'My dear Effie,' he wrote, 'I send you a copy of my new
number. You will find, on looking into the editorial columns,
that I have performed what I promised. Not only have I accepted
and published your very charming verses, but I have added a brief
note introducing the writer as a débutante of promise. So much
I am very pleased to have been able to do for you. Now, as one
writer introducing another, I leave you with your public. Give
them of your best. Let your first set of published verses prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
your worst. Aim at the best and highest; write in a spirit of
truth; let your Art be sincere and self-respectful.</p>

<p>'I am sorry that this note, written on Tuesday, could not
contain what I should much have wished to add, had I known it:
that your verses have been adapted to an old air by Miss Armorel
Rosevean. You did not, however, think fit to take me into your
confidence.</p>

<p>'I cannot hope to give you more than an occasional appearance
in my columns. I should advise you, with this introduction of
mine and the credentials of being published in my paper, to send
verses to the magazines. I think you will have little difficulty
with the help of my name in gaining admission.</p>

<p>'Allow me to add my congratulations on your brother's undoubted
success. His play is admirable as a chamber play. It
may also succeed on the stage, but of this it is impossible to be
certain. Meantime, it is very cheering to find that he listens to
the advice of those who have a right to speak, and that he follows
that advice. It is both cheering to his friends and promising as
regards his own future. I do not regret the time that I spent in
advising upon that play.</p>

<p class="signature2">'I remain, my dear Effie, very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="signature">
'<span class="smcap">Alec Feilding</span>.'
</p>

<p>The paper which contained the verses contained also the
following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In place of the usual editorial verses&mdash;my editorial duties do
not always give me leisure for the service of the Muse&mdash;I have
great pleasure in inserting a set of verses from the pen of a young
lady whose name is new to my readers. She makes her bow to my
readers in this column. I venture, however, to prophesy that she
will not long remain unknown. Wherever the English language
is spoken, before many years the name of Effie Wilmot shall be
known and loved. This is the prophecy of one who at least can
recognise good work when he sees it.'</p>

<p>Effie read both letter and paragraph to her brother, who raged
and stormed about the alleged advice and assistance. She also
read them both to Armorel, who only laughed a little.</p>

<p>'But,' said Effie, 'he never helped Archie at all! He gave
him no advice!'</p>

<p>'My dear, if he chooses to say that he did, what does it matter?
Time goes on, and every day will make your brother rise higher
and Mr. Feilding sink lower. And as to the verses, Effie, and
your&mdash;your first appearance'&mdash;Effie turned away her shamefaced
cheek&mdash;'why, we will take his advice and try other editors. Mr.
Feilding is, indeed, the cleverest man in London!'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII_2" id="CHAPTER_XVII_2"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE NATIONAL GALLERY</small></h2>


<p>Contrary to all reasonable expectation, Alec Feilding called at
Armorel's rooms the very next morning&mdash;and quite early in the
morning, when it was not yet eleven. Armorel, however, had
already gone out. He was received by Mrs. Elstree, who was, as
usual, sitting, apparently asleep, by the fire.</p>

<p>'You have come in the hope of seeing Armorel alone, I suppose?'
she said.</p>

<p>'Yes. You remember, Zoe,' he replied quickly&mdash;she observed
that he was pale, and that he fidgeted nervously, and that his eyes,
restless and scared, looked as if somebody was hunting him&mdash;'that
we had a talk about it. You said you wouldn't make a row. You
know you did. You consented.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! I remember. I am to play another part, and quite
a new one. You too are about to play a new part&mdash;one not generally
desired&mdash;quite the stage villain.' He made a gesture of impatience.
'Consider, however,' she went on quickly, before he
could speak. 'Do you think this morning&mdash;the day after yesterday&mdash;quite
propitious for your purpose?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' he asked quickly. 'Why not the day
after yesterday?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. Still, if I might advise&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Zoe, you know nothing at all. And time presses. If there
was reason, a week ago, for me to be the reputed and accepted
lover of this girl, there is tenfold more reason now. You don't
know, I say. For Heaven's sake don't spoil things now by any
interference.'</p>

<p>He was at least in earnest. Mrs. Elstree contemplated him
with curiosity. It seemed as if she had never seen him really in
earnest before. But now she understood. He knew by this time
that Armorel had discovered the source, the origins, of his greatness.
She might destroy him by a word. This knowledge would
pierce the hide of the most pachydermatous: his strength, you see,
was like that of Samson&mdash;it depended on a secret: it also now
resembled that of Samson in that it lay at the mercy of a woman.</p>

<p>'Alec,' said Mrs. Elstree, softly, 'you were greatly moved last
night by several things&mdash;by the play, by the picture, by the song.
I watched you. While the rest were listening to the play, I
watched you. The room was dark, and you thought no one could
see you. But I could make out your features. Armorel watched
you, too, but for other motives. I was wondering. She was triumphant.
You know why?'</p>

<p>'What do you know?'</p>

<p>'Your face, which is generally so well under command, expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
surprise, rage, disgust, and terror&mdash;all these passions, dear
Alec. On the stage we study how to express them. We represent
an exaggeration so that the gallery shall understand, and we call
it Art. But I know the symptoms.'</p>

<p>'What else do you know, I ask?'</p>

<p>'This morning you are nervous and agitated. You are afraid
of something. Alec, you know what I think of the cruelty and
hardheartedness of this project of yours&mdash;to sustain your credit
on an engagement which will certainly not last a month&mdash;I could
not possibly suffer the girl to be entangled longer than that&mdash;now
give it over.'</p>

<p>'I cannot give it over: it is my only chance. Zoe, you don't
know the mischief she has done me, and will do me again. It is
ruin&mdash;ruin!'</p>

<p>'Well then, Alec, don't go after her to-day. Indeed, I advise
you not. You are not in a condition to approach the subject, and
she is not in a condition to be approached. I do not ask your
reasons, or the kind of mischief you mean. I sit here and watch.
In the course of time I find out all things.'</p>

<p>'How much do you know, Zoe? What have you found out?'</p>

<p>'Knowledge, Alec, is power. Should I part in a moment, and
for nothing, with what I have acquired at the expense of a great
deal of contriving and putting together? Certainly not. You can
go and find Armorel, if you persist in choosing such a day for such
a purpose. She has gone, I believe, to the National Gallery.'</p>

<p>'I must find her to-day. I must bring things to a head.
Good Heavens! I don't know what new mischief they may be
designing.'</p>

<p>'Go home and wait, Alec. No one will do anything to you to-day.
You are nervous and excited.'</p>

<p>'You don't understand, I say. Tell me, did the men talk last
night&mdash;about me&mdash;in your hearing?'</p>

<p>'Not in my hearing, certainly. Go home and rest, Alec.'</p>

<p>'I cannot rest. I must find the girl.'</p>

<p>'Well, if you want her&mdash;go and find her. Alec, remember, if
you stood the faintest chance of success with her, I think I should
have to get up and warn her. Even for your sake I do not think
I could suffer this wickedness to be done. But you have no chance&mdash;none&mdash;not
on any day, particularly on this day&mdash;and after last
night. Go, however&mdash;go.'</p>

<p>When things have gone so far that assignations and appointments
are made and places of secret meeting agreed upon, there is
hardly any place in the whole of London more central, more convenient,
or safer than the National Gallery. Here the young lady
of society may be perfectly certain of remaining undiscovered. At
the South Kensington no one is quite safe, because in the modern
enthusiasm for art all kinds of people&mdash;even people in society&mdash;sometimes
go there to see embroideries and hangings, and handiwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of every sort. The India Museum is perhaps safer even than
the National Gallery&mdash;safer, for such a purpose, than any other
spot in the world. But there is a loneliness in its galleries which
strikes a chill to the most ardent heart, and damps the spirit of the
most resolute lover.</p>

<p>In the National Gallery there are plenty of people: but they
are all country visitors, or Americans, or copyists: never any
people of the young lady's own set: and there is never any crowd.
One can sit and talk undisturbed and quiet: the copyists chatter
or go on with their work regardless of anything: the attendants
slumber: the visitors pass round room after room, looking for
pictures which have a story to tell&mdash;and a story which they can
read. That, you see, is the only kind of picture&mdash;unless it be
a picture of a pretty face&mdash;which the ordinary visitor commonly
understands. Not many young people know of this place, and those
who do keep the knowledge to themselves. The upper rooms of
the British Museum are also commended by some for the same
reason, but the approaches are difficult.</p>

<p>This use of the National Gallery once understood, the thing
which happened here the day after the reading of the play will not
seem incredible, though it certainly was not intended by the
architect when he designed the building. Otherwise there might
have been convenient arbours.</p>

<p>Armorel went often to the Gallery: the English girl reserves,
as a rule, her study of pictures, and art generally, till she gets to
Florence. Armorel, who had also studied art in Florence, found
much to learn in our own neglected Gallery. Sometimes she went
alone: sometimes she went with Effie, and then, being quite a
learned person in the matter of pictures and their makers, she
would discourse from room to room, till the day was all too short.
The country visitors streamed past her in languid procession: the
lovers met by appointment at her very elbow: the copyists flirted,
talked scandal, wasted time, and sighed for commissions: but
Armorel had not learned to watch people: she came to see the
pictures: she had not begun to detach an individual from the
crowd as a representative: in other words, she was not a novelist.</p>

<p>This morning she was alone. She carried a notebook and
pencil, and was standing before a picture making notes. It was a
wet morning: the rooms were nearly empty, and the galleries were
very quiet.</p>

<p>She heard a manly step striding across the floor. She half
turned as it approached her. Mr. Alec Feilding took off his hat.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Elstree told me you were here,' he said. 'I ventured to
follow.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'You&mdash;you&mdash;come often, I believe?' He looked pale, and, for
the first time in Armorel's recollection of him, he was nervous.
'There is, I believe, a good deal to be learned here.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>'There is, especially by those who want to paint&mdash;of course, I
mean&mdash;who want to do their own paintings by themselves. Mr.
Feilding, frankly, what do you want? Why do you come here in
search of me?' Her face hardened: her eyes were cold and
resolved. But the man was full of himself; he noted not these
symptoms.</p>

<p>'I came because I have something to say.'</p>

<p>'Of importance?'</p>

<p>'Of great importance.'</p>

<p>'Not, I hope, connected with Art. Do not talk to me about
Art, if you please, Mr. Feilding&mdash;not about any kind of Art.'</p>

<p>He bowed gravely. 'One cannot always listen to conversation
involving canons and first principles,' he said, with much condescension.
'Let me, however, congratulate you on the promise of your
protégés, Archie and Effie Wilmot.'</p>

<p>'They are clever.'</p>

<p>'They are distinctly clever,' he repeated, recovering his usual
self-possession. 'Effie, as perhaps she has told you, has been my
pupil for a long time.'</p>

<p>'She has told me, in fact, something about her relations to
you.'</p>

<p>'Yes.' The man was preoccupied and rather dense by nature.
Therefore he caught only imperfectly these side meanings in
Armorel's replies. 'Yes&mdash;quite so&mdash;I have been able to be useful
to her, and to her brother also&mdash;very useful, indeed, happily.'</p>

<p>'And to&mdash;to others&mdash;as well&mdash;very useful, indeed,' Armorel
echoed.</p>

<p>He understood that there was some kind of menace in these
words. But the very air, this morning, was full of menace. He
passed them by.</p>

<p>'It is a curious coincidence that you should also have taken up
this interesting pair. It ought to bring us closer.'</p>

<p>'Quite the contrary, Mr. Feilding. It puts us far more widely
apart.'</p>

<p>'I do not understand that. We have a common interest. For
instance, only the other day I accepted a poem of Effie's&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Only the other day, Mr. Feilding?'</p>

<p>'Yes, the day before yesterday. I had it set up, and I added
a few words introducing the writer. That was the day before
yesterday. Judge of my astonishment when, only yesterday, you
sang that very song, and handed it round printed with the accompaniment.
I have made no alteration. The verses will appear
to-night, with my laudatory introduction. Some men might complain
that they had not been taken into confidence. But I do not.
Effie is a little genius in her way. She is not practical: she does
not understand that having disposed of her verses to one editor she
is not free to give them to another. But I do not complain, if
your action in her cause brings her into notice.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was a turning of tables! Now, some men overdo a thing.
They smile too much: they rub their hands nervously: they show
a nervous anxiety to be believed. Not so this man. He spoke
naturally&mdash;he had now recovered his usual equanimity: he looked
blankly unconscious that any doubt could possibly be thrown upon
his word. Since he said it, the thing must be so. Men of honour
have always claimed and exacted this concession. Therefore, the
following syllogism:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Mr. Alec Feilding is a man of honour:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everybody must acknowledge so much.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A man of honour cannot lie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else&mdash;what becomes of his honour?<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Therefore:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Any statement made by Mr. Alec Feilding is literally true.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Armorel showed no doubt in her face. Why should she?
There was no doubt in her mind. The man was a Liar.</p>

<p>'The Wilmots will get on,' she said coldly, 'without any help
from anybody. Now, Mr. Feilding, you came to say something
important to me. Shall we go on to that important communication?'
She took a seat on the divan in the middle of the room.
He stood over her, 'There is no one here this morning,' she said.
'You can speak as freely as in your own study.'</p>

<p>'Among your many fine qualities, Miss Rosevean,' he began
floridly, but with heightened colour, 'a certain artistic reserve is
reckoned by your friends, perhaps, the highest. It makes you
queenly.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Feilding, I cannot possibly discuss my own qualities with
any but my friends.'</p>

<p>'Your friends! Surely, I also&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My friends, Mr. Feilding,' Armorel repeated, bristling like
the fretful porcupine. But the man, preoccupied and thick of
skin, and full of vainglory and conceit, actually did not perceive
these quills erect. Armorel's pointed remarks did not prick his
hide: her coldness he took for her customary reserve. Therefore
he hurried to his doom.</p>

<p>'Give me,' he said, 'the right to speak to you as your dearest
friend. You cannot possibly mistake the attentions that I have
paid to you for the last few weeks. They must have indicated to
you&mdash;they were, indeed, deliberately designed to indicate&mdash;a
preference&mdash;deepening into a passion&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I think you had better stop at once, Mr. Feilding.'</p>

<p>There are many men who honestly believe that they are irresistible.
It seems incredible, but it is really true. It is the consciousness
of masculine superiority carried to an extreme. They
think that they have only to repeat the conventional words in the
conventional manner for the woman to be subjugated. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
come: they conquer. Now, this man, who plainly saw that he
was to a certain extent&mdash;he did not know how far&mdash;detected,
actually imagined that the woman who had detected him in a
gigantic fraud one day would accept his proffered hand and heart the
very next day! There are no bounds, you see, to personal vanity.
Besides, for this man, if it was necessary that he should appear as
the accepted suitor of a rich girl, it was doubly necessary that the
girl should be the one woman in the world who could do mischief.
He was anxious to discover how much she knew. But of his
wooing he had no anxiety at all. He should speak: she would
yield: she could do nothing else.</p>

<p>'Permit me,' he replied blandly, 'to go on. I am, as you know,
a leader in the world of Art. I am known as a painter, a poet,
and a writer of fiction. I have other ambitions still.'</p>

<p>'Doubtless you will succeed in these as you have succeeded in
those three Arts.'</p>

<p>'Thank you.' He really did not see the meaning of her words.
'I take your words as of happy augury. Armorel&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, Sir! Not my Christian name, if you please.'</p>

<p>'Give me the right to call you by your Christian name.'</p>

<p>'You are asking me to marry you. Is that what you mean?'</p>

<p>'It is nothing less.'</p>

<p>'Really! When I tell you, Mr. Feilding, that I know you&mdash;that
I know you&mdash;it will be plain to you that the thing is
absolutely impossible.'</p>

<p>'To know me,' he replied, showing no outward emotion,
'should make it more than possible. What could I wish better
than to be known to you?'</p>

<p>She looked him full in the face. He neither dropped his eyes
nor changed colour.</p>

<p>'What could be better for me?' he repeated. 'What could
I hope for better than to be known?'</p>

<p>'Oh! This man is truly wonderful!' she cried. 'Must I tell
you what I know?'</p>

<p>'It would be better, perhaps. You look as if you knew
something to my&mdash;actually&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;actually to my
discredit!'</p>

<p>Armorel gasped. His impudence was colossal.</p>

<p>'To your discredit! Oh! Actually to your discredit! Sir,
I know the whole of your disgraceful history&mdash;the history of the
past three or four years. I know by what frauds you have passed
yourself off as a painter and as a poet. I know by what pretences
you thought to lay the foundation for a reputation as a dramatist.
I know that your talk is borrowed&mdash;that you do not know art
when you see it: that you could never write a single line of verse&mdash;and
that of all the humbugs and quacks that ever imposed
themselves upon the credulity of people you are the worst and
biggest.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>He stared with a wonder which was, at least, admirably acted.</p>

<p>'Good Heavens!' he said. 'These words&mdash;these accusations&mdash;from
you? From Armorel Rosevean&mdash;cousin of my cousin&mdash;whom
I had believed to be a friend? Can this be possible? Who
has put this wonderful array of charges into your head?'</p>

<p>'That matters nothing. They are true, and you know it.'</p>

<p>'They are so true,' he replied sternly, 'that if anyone were to
dare to repeat these things before a third person, I should instantly&mdash;instantly&mdash;instruct
my solicitors to bring an action for libel.
Remember: youth and sex would not avail to protect that libeller.
If anyone&mdash;anyone&mdash;dares, I say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! say no more. Go, and do not speak to me again! What
will be done with this knowledge, I cannot say. Perhaps it will
be used for the exposure which will drive you from the houses of
honest people. Go, I say!'</p>

<p>She stamped her foot and raised her voice, insomuch that two
drowsy attendants woke up and looked round, thinking they had
dreamed something unusual.</p>

<p>The injured man of Art and Letters obeyed. He strode away.
He, who had come pale and hesitating, now, on learning the truth
which he had suspected and on receiving this unmistakable
rejection, walked away with head erect and lofty mien. He
showed, at least by outward bearing, the courage which is
awakened by a declaration of war.</p>

<small>CONGRATULATIONS</small></h2>


<p>In the afternoon of the same day Armorel received a visit from
a certain Lady Frances, of whom mention has already been made.
She was sitting in her own room, alone. The excitements of the
last night and of the morning were succeeded by a gentle melancholy.
These things had not been expected when she took her
rooms and plunged into London life. Besides, after these
excitements the afternoon was flat.</p>

<p>Lady Frances came in, dressed beautifully, gracious and cordial;
she took both Armorel's hands in her own, and looked as if she
would have kissed her but for conscientious scruples: she was
five-and-forty, or perhaps fifty, fat, comfortable, and rosy-cheeked.
And she began to talk volubly. Not in the common and breathless
way of volubility which leaves out the stops; but steadily and
irresistibly, so that her companion should not be able to get in one
single word. Well-bred persons do not leave out their commas
and their full stops: but they do sometimes talk continuously,
like a cataract or a Westmoreland Force, at least.</p>

<p>'My dear,' she said, 'I told your maid that I wanted to see
you alone, and in your own room. She said Mrs. Elstree was out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
So I came in. It is a very pretty little room. They tell me you
play wonderfully. This is where you practise, I suppose.' She
put up her glasses and looked round, as if to see what impression
had been produced on the walls by the music. 'And I hear also
that you paint and draw. My dear, you are the very person for
him.' Again she looked round. 'A very pretty room, really&mdash;wonderful
to observe how the taste for decoration and domestic
art has spread of late years!' A doubtful compliment, when you
consider it. 'Well, my dear, as an old friend of his&mdash;at all events,
a very useful friend of his&mdash;I am come to congratulate you.'</p>

<p>'To congratulate me?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I thought I would be one of the first. I asked him
two or three days ago if it was settled, and he confessed the truth,
but begged me not to spread it abroad, because there were lawyers
and people to see. Of course, his secrets are mine. And, except
my own very intimate friends and one or two who can be perfectly
trusted, I don't think I have mentioned the thing to a soul. I
dare say, however, the news is all over the town by this time.
Wonderful how things get carried&mdash;a bird of the air&mdash;the flying
thistledown&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I do not understand, Lady Frances.'</p>

<p>'My dear, you need not pretend, because he confessed. And
I think you are a very lucky girl to catch the cleverest man in all
London, and he certainly is a lucky man to catch such a pretty
girl as you. They say that he has got through all his money&mdash;men
of genius are always bad men of business&mdash;but your own
fortune will set him up again&mdash;a hundred thousand, I am told&mdash;mind
you have it all settled on yourself. No one knows what may
happen. I could tell you a heartrending story of a girl who
trusted her lover with her money. But your lawyers will, of
course, look after that.'</p>

<p>'I assure you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'He tells me,' the lady went on, without taking any notice of
the interruption, 'that the thing will not come off for some time
yet. I wouldn't keep it waiting too long, if I were you. Engagements
easily get stale. Like buns. Well, I suppose you have
learned all his secrets by this time: of course he is madly in love,
and can keep nothing from you.'</p>

<p>'Indeed&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Has he told you yet who writes his stories for him? Eh?
Has he told you that?' The lady bent forward and lowered her
voice, and spoke earnestly. 'Has he told you?'</p>

<p>'I assure you that he has told me nothing&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That is in reality what I came about. Because, my dear,
there must be a little plain speaking.'</p>

<p>'Oh! but let me speak&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'When I have said what I came to say'&mdash;Lady Frances
motioned with her hand gently but with authority&mdash;'then you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
shall have your turn. Men are so foolish that they tell their
sweethearts everything. The chief reason why they fall in love,
I believe, is a burning desire to have somebody to whom they can
tell everything. I know a man who drove his wife mad by constantly
telling her all his difficulties. He was always swimming in
difficulties. Well, Alec is bound to tell you before long, even if
he has not told you yet, which I can hardly believe. Now, my
dear child, it matters very little to him if all the world knew the
truth. All the world, to be sure, credits him with those stories,
though he has been very careful not to claim them. He knows
better. I say to such a clever man as Alec a few stories, more or
less, matter nothing. But it matters a great deal to me'&mdash;what
was this person talking about?&mdash;'because, you see, if it were to
come out that I had been putting together old family scandals and
forgotten stories, and sending them to the papers&mdash;there would be&mdash;there
would be&mdash;Heaven knows what there would be! Yes, my
dear&mdash;you can tell Alec that you know&mdash;I am the person who has
written those stories. I wrote them, every one. They are all
family stories&mdash;every good old family has got thousands of stories,
and I have been collecting them&mdash;some of my own people, some
of my husband's, and some of other people&mdash;and writing them
down, changing names, and scenes, and dates, so that they should
not be identified except by the few who knew them.'</p>

<p>Armorel made no further attempt to stem the tide of communication.</p>

<p>'I have come to make you understand clearly, young lady,
that it is not his secret alone, but mine. You would do him a
little harm, perhaps&mdash;I don't know&mdash;by letting it out, but you
would do me an infinity of harm. I write them down, you see,
and I take them to Alec, and he alters them&mdash;puts the style right&mdash;or
says he does&mdash;though I never see any difference in them when
they come out in the paper. And everybody who knows the story
asks how in the name of wonder he got it.'</p>

<p>'Oh! But I do assure you that I know nothing at all of this.'</p>

<p>'Don't you? Well, never mind. Now you do know. And you
know also that you can't talk about it, because it is his secret as
well as mine. Why, you don't suppose that the man really does
all he says he does, do you? Nobody could. It isn't in nature.
Everybody who knows anything at all agrees that there must be a
ghost&mdash;perhaps more than one. I'm the story ghost. I dare say
there's a picture ghost, and a poetry ghost. He's a wonderful
clever man, no doubt&mdash;it's the cleverest thing in the world to make
other people work for you; but don't imagine, pray, that he can
write stories of society. Bourgeois stories&mdash;about the middle class&mdash;his
own class&mdash;perhaps; but not stories about Us. My stories
belong to quite another level. Well, my dear, that is off my mind.
Remember that this secret would do a great deal of harm to him as
well as to me if it were to get about.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! You are altogether&mdash;wholly&mdash;wrong&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My dear, I really do not care if I am wrong. You will not,
however, damage his reputation by letting out his secrets? A wife
can help her husband in a thousand ways, and especially in keeping
up the little deceptions. Thousands of wives, I am told, pass their
whole lives in the pretence that they and their husbands are gentlefolk.
Alec has been received into a few good houses; and though
it is, of course, more difficult to get a woman in than a man, I will
really do what I can for you. With a good face, good eyes, a good
figure, and a little addition of style, you ought to get on very well
by degrees. Or you might take the town by storm, and become a
professional beauty.'</p>

<p>'Thank you&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And there's another thing. As an old friend of Alec's, I feel
that I can give advice to you. Let me advise you earnestly, my
dear, to make all the haste you can to get rid of your companion.
I know all about it. She was sent to your lawyer's
by Alec himself. Why? Well, it is an old story, and I suppose
he wanted to place her comfortably&mdash;or he had some other reason.
He's always been a crafty man. You can see that in his eyes.'</p>

<p>'Oh! But I cannot listen to this!' cried Armorel.</p>

<p>'Nonsense, my dear. You do not expect your husband to be an
angel, I suppose. Only silly middle-class girls who read novels do
that. It will do you no harm to know that the man is no better
than his neighbours. And I am sure he is no worse. I am speaking,
in fact, for your own good. My dear child, Alec ran after the
woman years ago. She was rich then, and used to go about. Certain
houses do not mind who enter within their gates. They lived
in Palace Gardens, and Monsieur le Papa was rich&mdash;oh! rich <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
millions</i>&mdash;and the daughter was sugar-sweet and as innocent as an
angel&mdash;fluffy hair, all tangled and rebellious&mdash;you know the kind&mdash;and
large blue, wondering eyes, generally lowered until the time
came for lifting them in the faces of young men. It was deadly,
my dear. I believe she might have married anybody she pleased.
There was the young Earl of Silchester&mdash;he wanted her. What a
fool she was not to take him! No; she was spoony on Alec
Feilding&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! I must not!' cried Armorel again.</p>

<p>'My dear, I'm telling you. Her papa went smash&mdash;poor thing!&mdash;a
grand, awful, impossible smash; other people's money mixed up
in it. A dozen workhouses were filled with the victims, I believe.
That kind of smash out of which it is impossible to pull yourself
anyhow. Killed himself, therefore. Went out of the world without
invitation by means of a coarse, vulgar, common piece of two-penny
rope, tied round his great fat neck. I remember him.
What did the girl do? Ran away from society: went on the stage
as one of a travelling company. Why, I saw her myself three
years ago at Leamington. I knew her instantly. "Aha!" I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
"there's Miss Fluffy, with the appealing, wondering eyes. Poor
thing! Here is a come down in the world!" Now I find her
here&mdash;your companion&mdash;a widow&mdash;widow of one Jerome Elstree
deceased&mdash;artist, I am told. I never heard of the gentleman, and
I confess I have my doubts as to his existence at all.'</p>

<p>Armorel ceased to offer any further opposition to the
stream.</p>

<p>'The innocent, appealing blue eyes: the childish face: oh! I
remember. My dear, I hope you will not have any reason to be
jealous of Mrs. Elstree. But take care. There were other girls,
too, now I come to think about it. There was his cousin, Philippa
Rosevean. Everybody knows that he went as far with her as a
man can go, short of an actual engagement. Canon Langley, of
St. Paul's, wants to marry her. She's an admirable person for an
ecclesiastical dignitary's wife&mdash;beautiful, cold, and dignified. But,
as yet, she has not accepted him. They say he will be a bishop.
And they say she loves her cousin Alec still. Women are generally
dreadful fools about men. But I don't know. I don't think,
if I were you, I should be jealous of Philippa. There's another
little girl, too, I have seen coming out of his studio. But she's
only a model, or something. If you begin to be jealous about the
models, there will be no end. Then, there are hundreds of girls
about town&mdash;especially those who can draw and paint a little, or
write a silly little song&mdash;who think they are greatly endowed with
genius, and would give their heads to get your chance. You are
a lucky girl, Miss Armorel Rosevean; but I would advise you, in
order to make the most of your good fortune, to change your
companion quickly. Persuade her to try the climate of Australia.
Else, there may be family jars.'</p>

<p>Here she stopped. She had said what was in her mind.
Whether she came to say this out of the goodness of her heart; or
whether she intended to make a little mischief between the girl
and her lover; or whether she supposed Armorel to be a young
lady who accepts a lover with no illusions as to imaginary perfections,
so that a new weakness discovered here and there would not
lower him in her opinion, I cannot say. Lady Frances was generally
considered a good-natured kind of person, and certainly she
had no illusions about perfection in any man.</p>

<p>'May I speak now?' asked Armorel.</p>

<p>'Certainly, my dear. It was very good of you to hear me
patiently. And I've said all I wanted to. Keep my secret, and
get rid of your companion, and I'll take you in hand.'</p>

<p>'Thank you. But you would not suffer me to explain that you
are entirely mistaken. I am not engaged to Mr. Feilding at all.'</p>

<p>'But he told me that you were.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but he also tells the world, or allows the world to
believe, that he writes your stories. I am not engaged to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Feilding, Lady Frances, and, what is more, I never shall be
engaged to that man&mdash;never!'</p>

<p>'Have you quarrelled already?'</p>

<p>'We have not quarrelled, because before people quarrel they
must be on terms of some intimacy. We have never been more
than acquaintances.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;but&mdash;child&mdash;he has been seen with you constantly.
At theatres, at concerts, in the park, in galleries&mdash;everywhere, he
has been walking with you as if he had the right.'</p>

<p>'I could not help that. Besides, I never thought&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Never thought? Why, where were you brought up? Never
thought? Good gracious! what do young ladies go into society
for?'</p>

<p>'I am not a young lady of society, I am afraid.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;but&mdash;what was your companion about, to allow&mdash;&mdash; Oh!'&mdash;Lady
Frances nodded her head&mdash;'oh! now I understand. Now
one can understand why he got her placed here. Now one understands
her business. My dear, you have been placed in a very
dangerous position&mdash;most dangerous. Your guardians or lawyers
are very much to blame. And you really never suspected anything?'</p>

<p>'How should I suspect? I was always told that Mr. Feilding
was not the man to begin that kind of thing.'</p>

<p>'Were you? Your companion told you that, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Oh! I suppose so. There seems a horrid network of deception
all about me, Lady Frances.' Armorel rose, and her visitor
followed her example. 'You have put a secret into my hands.
I shall respect it. Henceforth, I desire but one more interview
with this man. Oh! he is all lies&mdash;through and through. There
is no part of him that is true.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, my dear; you take things too seriously. We
all have our little reservations, and some deceptions are necessary.
When you get to my age you will understand. Why won't you
marry the man? He is young: his manners are pretty good: he
is a man of the world: he is really clever: he is quite sure to get
on, particularly if his wife help him. He means to get on. He is
the kind of man to get on. You see he is clever enough to take
the credit of other people's work: to make others work for you
is the first rule in the art of getting on. Oh! he will do. I shall
live to see him made a baronet, and in the next generation his son
will marry money, and go up into the Lords. That is the way.
My dear, you had better take him. You will never get a more
promising offer. You seem to me rather an unworldly kind
of girl. You should really take advice of those who know the
world.'</p>

<p>'I could never&mdash;never&mdash;marry Mr. Feilding.</p>

<p>'Wealth, position, society, rank, consideration&mdash;these are the
only things in life worth having, and you are going to throw them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
away! My dear, is there actually nothing between you at all?
Was it all a fib?'</p>

<p>'Actually nothing at all, except that he offered himself to me
this very morning, and he received an answer which was, I hope,
plain enough.'</p>

<p>'Ah! now I see.' Lady Frances laughed. 'Now I understand,
my dear, the vanity of the man! The creature, when he
told me that fib, thought it was the truth because he had made up
his mind to ask you, and, of course, he concluded that no one
could say "No" to him. Now I understand. You need not fall
into a rage about it, my dear. It was only his vanity. Poor dear
Alec! Well, he'll get another pretty girl, I dare say; but, my
dear, I doubt whether&mdash;&mdash; Rising men are scarce, you know.
Good-bye, child! Keep that little secret, and don't bear malice.
The vanity&mdash;the vanity of the men! Wonderful! wonderful!'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'And now,' cried Armorel, alone&mdash;'now there is nothing left.
Everything has been torn from him. He can do nothing&mdash;nothing.
The cleverest man&mdash;the very cleverest man in all
London!'</p>

<small>WHAT NEXT?</small></h2>


<p>Roland had moved into his new studio before Armorel became, as
she had promised, his model in the new picture. She began to go
there nearly every morning, accompanied by Effie, and faithfully
sat for two or three hours while the painting went on. It was the
picture which he had begun under the old conditions, her own figure
being substituted for that of the girl which the artist originally
designed. The studio was one of a nest of such offices crowded
together under a great roof and lying on many floors. The others
were, I dare say, prettily furnished and decorated with the customary
furniture of a studio, with pictures, sketches, screens, and pretty
things of all kinds. This studio was nothing but a great gaunt
room, with a big window, and no furniture in it except an easel, a
table, and two or three chairs. There was simply nothing else.
Under the pressure of want and failure the unfortunate artist had
long ago parted with all the pretty things with which he had begun
his career, and the present was no time to replace them.</p>

<p>'I have got the studio,' he said, 'for the remainder of a lease,
pretty cheap. Unfortunately, I cannot furnish it yet. Wait until
the tide turns. I am full of hope. Then this arid wall and this
great staring Sahara of a floor shall blossom with all manner of
lovely things&mdash;armour and weapons, bits of carving and tapestry,
drawings. You shall see how jolly it will be.'</p>

<p>Next to the studio there were two rooms. In one of these, his
bedroom, he had placed the barest necessaries; the other was empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and unfurnished, so that he had no place to sit in during the evening
but his gaunt and ghostly studio. However, the tide had turned
in one respect. He was now full of hope.</p>

<p>There is no better time for conversation than when one is sitting
for a portrait or standing for a model. The subject has to remain
motionless. This would be irksome if silence were imposed as well
as inaction. Happily, the painter finds that his sitter only exhibits
a natural expression when he or she is talking and thinking about
something else. And, which is certainly a Providential arrangement,
the painter alone among mortals, if we except the cobbler,
can talk and work at the same time. I do not mean that he can
talk about the Differential Calculus, or about the relations of Capital
and Labour, or about a hot corner in politics: but he can talk of
things light, pleasant, and on the surface.</p>

<p>'I feel myself back in Scilly,' said Armorel. 'Whenever I come
here and think of what you are painting, I am in the boat, watching
the race of the tide through the channel. The puffins are swarming
on Camber Rock, and swimming in the smooth water outside: there
is the head of a seal, black above the water, shining in the sunlight&mdash;how
he flounders in the current! The sea-gulls are flying and
crying overhead: the shags stand in rows upon the farthest rocks:
the sea-breeze blows upon my cheek. I suppose I have changed so
much that when I go back I shall have lost the old feeling. But
it was joy enough in those days only to sit in the boat and watch
it all. Do you remember, Roland?'</p>

<p>'I remember very well. You are not changed a bit, Armorel:
you have only grown larger and&mdash;&mdash;' 'More beautiful,' he would
have added, but refrained. 'You will find that the old joy will
return again&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la joie de vivre</i>&mdash;only to breathe and feel and look
around. But it will be then ten times as joyous. If you loved
Scilly when you were a child and had seen nothing else, how much
more will you love the place now that you have travelled and seen
strange lands and other coasts and the islands of the Mediterranean!'</p>

<p>'I fear that I shall find the place small: the house will have
shrunk&mdash;children's houses always shrink. I hope that Holy Farm
will not have become mean.'</p>

<p>'Mean? with the verbena-trees, the fuchsias, the tall pampas-grass,
and the palms! Mean? with the old ship's lanthorn and the
gilded figure-head? Mean, Armorel? with the old orchard behind
and the twisted trees with their fringe of grey moss? You talk
rank blasphemy! Something dreadful will happen to you.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps it will be I myself, then, that will have grown mean
enough to think the old house mean. But Samson is a very little
place, isn't it? One cannot make out Samson to be a big place.
I could no longer live there always. We will go there for three or
four months every year; just for refreshment of the soul, and then
return here among men and women or travel abroad together, Effie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
We could be happy for a time there: we could sail and row about
the rocks in calm weather: and in stormy weather we should watch
the waves breaking over the headlands, and in the evening I would
play "The Chirping of the Lark."'</p>

<p>'I am ready to go to-morrow, if you will take me with you,'
said Effie.</p>

<p>Then they were silent again. Roland walked backwards and
forwards, brush and palette in hand, looking at his model and at
his canvas. Effie stood beside the picture, watching it grow. To
one who cannot paint, the growth of a portrait on the canvas is a
kind of magic. The bare outline and shape of head and face, the
colour of the eyes, the curve of the neck, the lines of the lips&mdash;anyone
might draw these. But to transfer to the canvas the very
soul that lies beneath the features&mdash;that, if you please, is different.
Oh! How does the painter catch the soul of the man and show it
in his face? One must be oneself an artist of some kind even to
appreciate the greatness of the portrait painter.</p>

<p>'When this picture is finished,' said Armorel, 'there will be
nothing to keep me in London; and we will go then.'</p>

<p>'At the very beginning of the season?'</p>

<p>'The season is nothing to me. My companion, Mrs. Elstree,
who was to have launched me so beautifully into the very best
society, turns out not to have any friends; so that there is no
society for me, after all. Perhaps it is as well.'</p>

<p>'Will Mrs. Elstree go to Scilly with you?' asked Roland.</p>

<p>'No,' said Armorel, with decision. 'On Samson, at least, one
needs no companion.'</p>

<p>Again they relapsed into silence for a space. Conversation in
the studio is fitful.</p>

<p>'I have a thing to talk over with you two,' she said. 'First,
I thought it would be best to talk about it to you singly; but now
I think that you should both hear the whole story, and so we can
all three take counsel as to what is best.'</p>

<p>'Your head a little more&mdash;so.' Roland indicated the movement
with his forefinger. 'That will do. Now pray go on, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'Once there was a man,' she began, as if she was telling a story
to children&mdash;and, indeed, there is no better way ever found out of
beginning a story&mdash;'a man who was, in no sense at all, and could
never become, try as much as he could, an artist. He was, in fact,
entirely devoid of the artistic faculty: he had no ear for music or
for poetry, no eye for beauty of form or for colour, no hand for
drawing, no brain to conceive: he was quite a prosaic person.
Whether he was clever in things that do not require the artistic
faculty, I do not know. I should hardly think he could be clever
in anything. Perhaps he might be good at buying cheap and selling
dear.'</p>

<p>'Won't you take five minutes' rest?' asked the painter; hardly
listening at all to the beginning, which, as you see, promised very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
little in the way of amusement. There are, however, many ways
by which the story-teller gets a grip of his hearer, and a dull beginning
is not always the least effective. He put down his palette.
'You must be tired,' he said. 'Come and tell me what you think.'
He looked thoughtfully at his picture. Armorel's poor little beginning
of a story was slighted.</p>

<p>'You are satisfied, so far?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I will tell you when it is finished. Is the water quite right?'</p>

<p>'We are in shoal, close behind us are the broad Black Rock
Ledges. The water might be even more transparent still. It is
the dark water racing through the narrow ravine that I think of
most. It will be a great picture, Roland. Now I will take my
place again.' She did so. 'And, with your permission, I will go
on with my story: you heard the beginning, Roland?'</p>

<p>'Oh! Yes! Unfortunate man with no eyes and no ears,' he
replied, unsuspecting. 'Worse than a one-eyed Calender.'</p>

<p>'This preposterous person, then, with neither eye, nor ear, nor
hand, nor understanding, had the absurd ambition to succeed.
This you will hardly believe. But he did. And, what is more, he
had no patience, but wanted to succeed all at once. I am told
that lots of young men, nowadays, are consumed with that yearning
to succeed all at once. It seems such a pity, when they should
be happily dancing and singing and playing at the time when they
were not working. I think they would succeed so very much better
afterwards. Well, this person very soon found that in the law&mdash;did
I say he was a barrister?&mdash;he had no chance of success except
after long years. Then he looked round the fields of art and
literature. Mind, he could neither write nor practise any art.
What was he to do? Every day the ambition to seem great filled
his soul more and more, and every day the thing appeared to him
more hopeless: because, you see, he had no imagination, and therefore
could not send his soul to sleep with illusions. I wonder he
did not go mad. Perhaps he did, for he resolved to pretend.
First, he thought he would pretend to be a painter'&mdash;here Roland,
who had been listening languidly, started, and became attentive.
'He could neither paint nor draw, remember. He began, I think,
by learning the language of Art. He frequented studios, heard the
talk and read the books. It must have been weary work for him.
But, of course, he was no nearer his object than before; and then
a great chance came to him. He found a young artist full of promise&mdash;a
real artist&mdash;one filled with the whole spirit of Art: but he
was starving. He was actually penniless, and he had no friends
who could help him, because he was an Australian by birth. This
young man was not only penniless, but in despair. He was ready
to do anything. I suppose, when one is actually starving and
sees no prospect of success or any hope, ambition dies away and
even self-respect may seem a foolish thing.' Roland listened now,
his picture forgotten. What was Armorel intending? 'It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
be a most dreadful kind of temptation. There can be nothing like
it in the world. That is why we pray for our daily bread. Oh!
a terrible temptation. I never understood before how great and
terrible a temptation it is. Then the man without eye, or hand,
or brain saw a chance for himself. He would profit by his brother's
weakness. He proposed to buy the work of this painter and to call
it his own.'</p>

<p>'Armorel, must you tell this story?'</p>

<p>'Patience, Roland. In his despair the artist gave way. He
consented. For three years and more he received the wages of&mdash;of
sin. But his food was like ashes in his mouth, and his front
was stamped&mdash;yes, stamped&mdash;by the curse of those who sin against
their own soul.'</p>

<p>'Armorel&mdash;&mdash;' But she went on, ruthless.</p>

<p>'The pictures were very good: they were exhibited, praised,
and sold. And the man grew quickly in reputation. But he wasn't
satisfied. He thought that as it was so easy to be a painter, it
would be equally easy to become a poet. All the Arts are allied:
many painters have been also poets. He had never written a
single line of poetry. I do not know that he had ever read any.
He found a girl who was struggling, working, and hoping.' Effie
started and turned roseate red. 'He took her poems&mdash;bought
them&mdash;and, on the pretence of having improved them and so made
them his own, he published them in his own name. They were
pretty, bright verses, and presently people began to look for them
and to like them. So he got a double reputation. But the poor
girl remained unknown. At first she was so pleased at seeing her
verses in print&mdash;it looked so much like success&mdash;that she hardly
minded seeing his name at the end. But presently he brought out
a little volume of them with his name on the title-page, and then
a second volume&mdash;also with his name&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The scoundrel!' cried Roland. 'He cribbed his poetry too?'</p>

<p>Effie bowed her face, ashamed.</p>

<p>'And then the girl grew unhappy. For she perceived that
she was in a bondage from which there was no escape except by
sacrificing the money which he gave her, and that was necessary
for her brother's sake. So she became very unhappy.'</p>

<p>'Very unhappy,' echoed Effie. Both painter and poet stood
confused and ashamed.</p>

<p>'Then this clever man&mdash;the cleverest man in London&mdash;began
to go about in society a good deal, because he was so great a
genius. There he met a lady who was full of stories.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Roland. 'Is there nothing in him at all?'</p>

<p>'Nothing at all. There is really nothing at all. This man
persuaded the lady to write down these stories, which were all
based on old family scandals and episodes unknown or forgotten
by the world. They form a most charming series of stories. I
believe they are written in a most sparkling style&mdash;full of wit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
life. Well, he did not put his name to them, but he allowed the
whole world to believe that they were his own.'</p>

<p>'Good Heavens!' cried Roland.</p>

<p>'And still he was not satisfied. He found a young dramatist
who had written a most charming play. He tried to persuade the
poor lad that his play was worthless, and he offered to take it
himself, alter it&mdash;but there needed no alteration&mdash;and convert it
into a play that could be acted. He would give fifty pounds for
the play, but it was to be his own.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Effie, savagely. 'He made that offer, but he will
not get the play.'</p>

<p>'You have heard, now, what manner of man he was. Very
well. I tell you two the story because I want to consult you.
The other day I arranged a little play of my own. That is, I invited
people to hear the reciting of that drama: I invited the
pretender himself among the rest, but he did not know or guess
what the play was going to be. And at the same time I invited
the painter and the poet. The former brought his unfinished
picture&mdash;the latter brought her latest poem, which the pretender
was going that very week to bring out in his own name. I had set
it to music, and I sang it. I meant that he should learn in this
way, without being told, that everything was discovered. I watched
his face during the recital of the play, and I saw the dismay of
the discovery creeping gradually over him as he realised that he
had lost his painter, his poet, and his dramatist. There remained
nothing more but to discover the author of the stories&mdash;and that,
too, I have found out. And I think he will lose his story-teller as
well. He will be deprived of all his borrowed plumes. At one
blow he saw himself ruined.'</p>

<p>Neither of the two made answer for a space. Then spoke
Roland: 'Dux femina facti! A woman hath done this.'</p>

<p>'He is ruined unless he can find others to take your places.
The question I want you to consider is&mdash;What shall be done next?
Roland, it is your name and fame that he has stolen&mdash;your pictures
that he has called his own. Effie, they are your poems that he
has published under his name. What will you do? Will you
demand your own again? Think.'</p>

<p>'He must exhibit no more pictures of mine,' said Roland.
'He has one in his studio that he has already sold. That one must
not go to any gallery. That is all I have to say.'</p>

<p>'He cannot publish any more poems of mine,' said Effie, 'because
he hasn't got any, and I shall give him no more.'</p>

<p>'What about the past?'</p>

<p>'Are we so proud of the past and of the part we have played in
it'&mdash;asked Roland&mdash;'that we should desire its story published to all
the world?'</p>

<p>Effie shook her head, approvingly.</p>

<p>'As for me,' he continued, 'I wish never to hear of it again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
It makes me sick and ashamed even to think of it. Let it be forgotten.
I was an unknown artist&mdash;I had few friends&mdash;I had
exhibited one picture only&mdash;so that my work was unknown&mdash;I
had painted for him six or seven pictures which are mostly bought
by an American. As for the resemblance of style, that may make
a few men talk for a season. Then it will be forgotten. I shall
remain&mdash;he will have disappeared. I am content to take my
chance with future work, even if at first I may appear to be a mere
copyist of Mr. Alec Feilding.'</p>

<p>'And you, Effie?'</p>

<p>'I agree with Mr. Lee,' she replied briefly. 'Let the past
alone. I shall write more verses, and, perhaps, better verses.'</p>

<p>'Then I will go to him and tell him that he need fear nothing.
We shall hold our tongues. But he is not to exhibit the picture
that is in his studio. I will tell him that.'</p>

<p>'You will not actually go to him yourself, Armorel&mdash;alone&mdash;after
what has passed?' asked Effie.</p>

<p>'Why not? He can do me no harm. He knows that he has
been found out, and he is tormented by the fear of what we shall
do next. I bring him relief. His reputation is secured&mdash;that is to
say, it will be the reputation of a man who stopped at thirty, in
the fulness of his first promise and his best powers, and did no
more work.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Effie. 'I thought he was so clever! I thought
that his desire to be thought a poet was only a little infirmity of
temper, which would pass. And, after all, to think that&mdash;&mdash;'
Here the poet looked at the painter, and the painter looked at the
poet&mdash;but neither spoke the thought: 'How could you&mdash;you, with
your pencil: how could you&mdash;you, with your pen&mdash;consent to the
iniquity of so great a fraud?'</p>

<small>A RECOVERY AND A FLIGHT</small></h2>


<p>Amid all these excitements Armorel became aware that something&mdash;something
of a painful and disagreeable character, was going on
with her companion. They were at this time very little together.
Mrs. Elstree took her breakfast in bed; at luncheon she was, just
now, nearly always out; at dinner she sat silent, pale, and anxious;
in the evening she lay back in her chair as if she was asleep. One
night Armorel heard her weeping and sobbing in her room. She
knocked at the door with intent to offer her help if she was ill.
'No, no,' cried Mrs. Elstree; 'you need not come in. I have
nothing but a headache.'</p>

<p>This thing as well disquieted her. She remembered what Lady
Frances had suggested&mdash;it is always the suggestion rather than the
bare fact which sticks and pricks like a thorn, and will not come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
out or suffer itself to be removed. Armorel thought nothing of the
allegation concerning the stage&mdash;why should not a girl go upon the
stage if she wished? The suggestion which pricked was that Mrs.
Elstree had been sent to her by the man whom she now knew to be
fraudulent through and through, in order to carry out some underhand
and secret design. There is nothing more horrid than the
suspicion that the people about one are treacherous. It reduces
one to the condition of primitive man, for whom every grassy
glade concealed a snake and every bush a wild beast. She tried to
shake off the suspicion, yet a hundred things confirmed it. Her
constant praise of this child of genius, his persistence in meeting
them wherever they went, the attempt to make her find money
for his schemes. The girl, thus irritated, began to have uneasy
dreams; she was as one caught in the meshes; she was lured into a
garden whence there was no escape; she was hunted by a cunning
and relentless creature; she was in a prison, and could not get out.
Always in her dreams Zoe stood on one side of her, crying, 'Oh, the
great and glorious creature!&mdash;oh, the cleverness of the man!&mdash;oh,
the wonder and the marvel of him!' And on the other side stood
Lady Frances, saying, 'Why don't you take him? He is a liar, it
is true, but he is no worse than his neighbours&mdash;all men are liars!
You can't get a man made on purpose for you. What is your
business in life at all but to find a husband? Why are girls in
Society at all except to catch husbands? And they are scarce, I
assure you. Why don't you take the man? You will never again
have such a chance&mdash;a rising man&mdash;a man who can make other
people work for him&mdash;a clever man. Besides, you are as good as
engaged to him: you have made people talk: you have been seen
with him everywhere. If you are not engaged to him you ought
to be.'</p>

<p>It was about a week after the reading of the play when this
condition of suspicion and unquiet was brought to an end in a very
unexpected manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Jagenal called at the rooms in the morning about ten
o'clock. Mrs. Elstree was taking breakfast in bed, as usual.
Armorel was alone, painting.</p>

<p>'My dear young lady,' said her kindly adviser, 'I would not
have disturbed you at this early hour but for a very important
matter. You are well and happy, I trust? No, you are not well
and happy. You look pale.'</p>

<p>'I have been a little worried lately,' Armorel replied. 'But
never mind now.'</p>

<p>'Are you quite alone here? Your companion, Mrs. Elstree?'</p>

<p>'She has not yet left her room. We are quite alone.'</p>

<p>'Very well, then.' The lawyer sat down and began nursing his
right knee. 'Very well. You remember, I dare say, making a
certain communication to me touching a collection of precious stones
in your possession? You made that communication to me five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
years ago, when first you came from Scilly. You returned to it
again when you arrived at your twenty-first birthday, and I handed
over to your own keeping all your portable property.'</p>

<p>'Of course I remember perfectly well.'</p>

<p>'Then does your purpose still hold?'</p>

<p>'It is still, and always, my duty to hand over those rubies to
their rightful owner&mdash;the heir of Robert Fletcher, as soon as he
can be found.'</p>

<p>'It is also my duty to warn you again, as I have done already,
that there is no reason at all why you should do so. You are the
sole heiress of your great-great-grandmother's estate. She died
worth a great sum of money in gold, besides treasures in plate,
works of art, lace, and jewels cut and uncut. The rambling story
of an aged woman cannot be received as evidence on the strength
of which you should hand over valuable property to persons unknown,
who do not even claim it, and know nothing about it.'</p>

<p>'I must hand over those rubies,' Armorel repeated, 'to the
person to whom they belong.'</p>

<p>'It is a very valuable property. If the estimate which was
made for me was correct&mdash;I see no reason to doubt it&mdash;those jewels
could be sold, separately, or in small parcels, for nearly thirty-five
thousand pounds&mdash;a fortune larger than all the rest of your property
put together&mdash;thirty-five thousand pounds!'</p>

<p>'That has nothing to do with the question, has it? I have got
to restore those jewels, you see, to their rightful owner, as soon as
he can be discovered.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;but&mdash;consider again. What have you got to go upon?
The story about Robert Fletcher may or may not be true. No one
can tell after this lapse of time. The things were found by you
lying in the old sea-chest with other things&mdash;all your own. Who
was this Robert Fletcher? Where are his heirs? If they claim
the property, and can prove their claim, give it up at once. If not,
keep your own. The jewels are undoubtedly your own as much as
the lace and the silks and the silver cups, which were all, I take it,
recovered from wrecks.'</p>

<p>'Do you disbelieve my great-great-grandmother's story, then?'</p>

<p>'I have neither to believe nor to disbelieve. I say it isn't
evidence. Your report of what she said, being then in her dotage,
amounts to just nothing, considered as evidence.'</p>

<p>'I am perfectly certain that the story is true. The leathern
thong by which the case hung round the man's neck has been
cut by a knife, just as granny described it in her story. And
there is the writing in the case itself. Nothing will persuade me
that the story is anything but true in every particular.'</p>

<p>'It may be true. I cannot say. At the same time, the
property is your own, and you would be perfectly justified in
keeping it.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Jagenal'&mdash;Armorel turned upon him sharply&mdash;'you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
found out Robert Fletcher's heir! I am certain you have. That is
the reason why you are here this morning.'</p>

<p>Mr. Jagenal laid upon the table a pocket-book full of papers.</p>

<p>'I will tell you what I have discovered. That is why I came
here. There has been, unfortunately, a good deal of trouble in
discovering this Robert Fletcher and in identifying one of the
Robert Fletchers we did discover with your man. We discovered,
in fact, ten Robert Fletchers before we came to the man who may
reasonably be supposed&mdash;&mdash; But you shall see.'</p>

<p>He opened the pocket-book, and found a paper of memoranda
from which he read his narrative:&mdash;</p>

<p>'There was one Robert Fletcher, the eleventh whom we unearthed.
This man promised nothing at first. He became a broker
in the City in the year 1810. In the same year he married a cousin,
daughter of another broker, with whom he entered into partnership.
He did so well that when he died, in the year 1846, then aged
sixty-nine, his will was proved under 80,000<i>l.</i> He left three
daughters, among whom the estate was divided, in equal shares.
The eldest of the daughters, Eleanor, remained unmarried, and
died two years ago, at the age of seventy-seven, leaving the whole
of her fortune&mdash;greatly increased by accumulations&mdash;to hospitals
and charities. I believe she was, in early life, alienated from her
family, on account of some real or fancied slight. However, she
died: and her papers came into the hands of my friends Denham,
Mansfield, Westbury, and Co., of New Square, Lincoln's Inn,
solicitors. Her second sister, Frances, born in the year 1813,
married in 1834, had one son, Francis Alexander, who was born in
1835, and married in 1857. Both Frances and her son are now
dead; but one son remained, Frederick Alexander, born in the
year 1859. The third daughter, Catharine, born in the year 1815,
married in 1835, and emigrated to Australia with her husband, a
man named Temple. I have no knowledge of this branch of the
family.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Armorel, 'I suppose the eldest son or grandson of
the second sister must have the rubies?'</p>

<p>'You are really in a mighty hurry to get rid of your property.
The next question&mdash;it should have come earlier&mdash;is&mdash;How do I
connect this Robert Fletcher with your Robert Fletcher? How
do we know that Robert Fletcher the broker was Robert Fletcher
the shipwrecked passenger? Well; Eleanor, the eldest, left a
bundle of family papers and letters behind her. Among them is a
packet endorsed "From my son Robert in India." Those letters,
signed "Robert Fletcher," are partly dated from Burmah, whither
the writer had gone on business. He gives his observations on the
manners and customs of the country, then little known or visited.
He says that he is doing very well, indeed: so well, he says
presently, that, thanks to a gift made to him by the King, he
is able to think about returning home with the means of staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
at home and doing no more work for the end of his natural
days.'</p>

<p>'Of course, he had those jewels.'</p>

<p>'Then he writes from Calcutta. He has returned in safety
from Burmah and the King, whose capricious temper had made
him tremble for his life. He is putting his affairs in order: he
has brought his property from Burmah in a portable form which
he can best realise in London: lastly, he is going to sail in a few
weeks. This is in the year 1808. According to your story it was
somewhere about that date that the wreck took place on the Scilly
Isles, and he was washed ashore, saved&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And robbed,' said Armorel.</p>

<p>'As we have no evidence of the fact,' answered the man of law,
'I prefer to say that the real story ends with the last of the letters.
It remained, however, to compare the handwriting of the letters
with that of the fragment of writing in your leather case. I took
the liberty to have a photograph made of that fragment while it
was in my possession, and I now ask you to compare the handwriting.'
He drew out of his pocket-book a letter&mdash;one of the
good old kind, on large paper, brown with age, and unprovided
with any envelope&mdash;and the photograph of which he was speaking.
'There,' he said, 'judge for yourself.'</p>

<p>'Why!' cried Armorel. 'The writing corresponds exactly!'</p>

<p>'It certainly does, letter for letter. Well; the conclusion of
the whole matter is that I believe the story of the old lady to be
correct in the main. On the other hand, there is nothing in the
papers to show the existence in the family of any recollection of so
great a loss. One would imagine that a man who had dropped&mdash;or
thought he had dropped&mdash;a bag, full of rubies, worth thirty-five
thousand pounds, into the sea would have told his children about
it, and bemoaned the loss all his life. Perhaps, however, he was
so philosophic as to grieve no more after what was hopelessly gone.
He was still in the years of hope when the misfortune befell him.
Possibly his children knew in general terms that the shipwreck had
caused a destruction of property. Again, a man of the City, with
the instincts of the City, would not like it to be known that he had
returned to his native country a pauper, while it would help him in
his business to be considered somewhat of a Nabob. Of this I
cannot speak from any knowledge I have, or from any discovery
that I have made.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Armorel, 'I cannot tell you what a weight has
been lifted from me. I have never ceased to long for the restoration
of those jewels ever since I found them in the sea-chest.'</p>

<p>'There is&mdash;as I said&mdash;only one descendant of the second sister&mdash;a
man&mdash;a man still young. You will give me your instructions in
writing. I am to hand over to this young man&mdash;this fortunate
young man&mdash;already trebly fortunate in another sense&mdash;this precious
packet of jewels. It is still, I suppose, in the bank?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is where you placed it for me when I came of age.'</p>

<p>'Very well. I have brought you an order for its delivery to
me. Will you sign it?'</p>

<p>Armorel heaved a great sigh. 'With what relief!' she said.
'Have you got it here?'</p>

<p>Mr. Jagenal gave her the order on the bank for the delivery of
sealed packet, numbered III., to himself. She signed it.</p>

<p>'To think,' she said, 'that by a simple stroke of the pen I can
remove the curse of those ill-gotten rubies! It is like getting rid
of all your sins at once. It is like Christian dropping his bundle.'</p>

<p>'I hope the rubies will not carry on this supposed curse of
yours.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Armorel, with a profound sigh, 'I feel as if the
poor old lady was present listening. Since I could understand anything,
I have understood that the possession of those rubies
brought disaster upon my people. From generation to generation
they have been drowned one after the other&mdash;my father&mdash;my
grandfather&mdash;my great-grandfather&mdash;my mother&mdash;my brothers&mdash;all&mdash;all
drowned. Can you wonder if I rejoice that the things will
threaten me no longer?'</p>

<p>'This is sheer superstition.'</p>

<p>'Oh! yes: I know, and yet I cannot choose but to believe it,
I have heard the story so often, and always with the same ending.
Now, they are gone.'</p>

<p>'Not quite gone. Nearly. As good as gone, however. Dismiss
this superstitious dread from your mind, my dear young
lady.'</p>

<p>'The rubies are gone. There will be no more of us swallowed
up in the cruel sea.'</p>

<p>'No more of you,' repeated Mr. Jagenal, with the incredulous
smile of one who has never had in his family a ghost, or a legend,
or a curse, or a doom, or a banshee, or anything at all distinguished.
'And now you will be happy. You don't ask me the name of the
fortunate young man.'</p>

<p>'No; I do not want to know anything more about the horrid
things.'</p>

<p>'What am I to say to him?'</p>

<p>'Tell him the truth.'</p>

<p>'I shall tell him that you discovered the rubies in an old sea-chest
with other property accumulated during a great many years:
that a scrap of paper with writing on it gave a clue to the owner:
and that, by means of other investigation, he has been discovered:
that it was next to impossible for your great-grandfather, Captain
Rosevean, to have purchased these jewels: and that the presumption
is that he recovered them from the wreck, and laid them in
the chest, saying nothing, and that the chest was never opened
until your succession to the property. That, my dear young lady,
is all the story that I have to tell. And now I will go away, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
congratulations to Donna Quixote in getting rid of thirty-five
thousand pounds.'</p>

<p>An hour or two afterwards, Mrs. Elstree appeared. She glided
into the room and threw herself into her chair, as if she desired to
sleep again. She looked harassed and anxious.</p>

<p>'Zoe,' cried Armorel, 'you are surely ill. What is it? Can I
do nothing for you?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. I only wish it was all over, or that I could go to
sleep for fifty years, and wake up an old woman&mdash;in an almshouse
or somewhere&mdash;all the troubles over. What a beautiful thing it
must be to be old and past work, with fifteen shillings a week, say,
and nothing to think about all day except to try and forget the
black box! If it wasn't for the black box&mdash;I know I should see
them always coming along the road with it&mdash;it must be the loveliest
time.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;but&mdash;what makes you look so ill?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. I am not ill. I am never ill. I would rather be
ill than&mdash;what I am. A tearing, rending neuralgia would be a
welcome change. Don't ask me any more questions, Armorel.
You look radiant, for your part. Has anything happened to you?&mdash;anything
good? You are one of those happy girls to whom only
good things come.'</p>

<p>'Do you remember the story I told you&mdash;about the rubies?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' She turned her face to the fire. 'I remember very
well.'</p>

<p>'I have at last&mdash;congratulate me, Zoe&mdash;I have got rid of
them.'</p>

<p>'You have got rid of them?' Mrs. Elstree started up. 'Where
are they, then?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Jagenal has been here. He has found a great-grandson
of Robert Fletcher, who is entitled to have them. I have never
been so relieved! The dreadful things are out of my hands now,
and in Mr. Jagenal's. He will give them to this grandson. Zoe,
what is the matter?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Elstree rose to her feet, and stood facing Armorel, with
eyes in which wild terror was the only passion visible, and white
cheeks. And, as Armorel was still speaking, she staggered,
reeled, and fell forwards in a faint. Armorel caught her, and bore
her to the sofa, when she presently came to herself again. But the
fainting fit was followed by hysterical weeping and laughing. She
knew not what she said. She raved about somebody who had
bought something. Armorel paid no heed to what she said. She
lamented the hour of her birth: she had been pursued by evil all
her life: she lamented the hour when she met a certain man, unnamed,
who had dragged her down to his own level: and so on.</p>

<p>When she had calmed a little, Armorel persuaded her to lie
down. It is a woman's chief medicine. It is better than all the
drugs in the museum of the College of Physicians. Mrs. Elstree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
pale and trembling, tearful and agitated, lay down. Armorel
covered her with a warm wrapper, and left her.</p>

<p>A little while afterwards she looked in. The patient was quite
calm now, apparently asleep, and breathing gently. Armorel,
satisfied with the result of her medicine, left her in charge of her
maid, and went out for an hour. She went out, in fact, to tell
Effie Wilmot the joyful news concerning those abominable rubies.
When she came back, in time for luncheon, she was met by her
maid, who gave her a letter, and told her a strange thing. Mrs.
Elstree had gone away! The sick woman, who had been raving in
hysterics, hardly able to support herself to her bed, had got up the
moment after Armorel left the house, packed all her boxes hurriedly,
sent her for a cab, and had driven away. But she had left
this note for Armorel. It was brief.</p>

<blockquote><p>'I am obliged to go away unexpectedly. In order to avoid
explanations and questions and farewells, I have thought it best to
go away quietly. I could not choose but go. For certain reasons
I must leave you. For the same reasons I hope that we may never
meet again. I ought never to have come here. Forgive me and
forget me. I will write to Mr. Jagenal to-day.</p>

<p class="signature">
'<span class="smcap">Zoe.</span>'</p></blockquote>

<p>There was no reason given. She had gone. Nor, if one may
anticipate, has Armorel yet discovered the reasons for this sudden
flight. Nor, as you will presently discover, will Armorel ever be
able to discover those reasons.</p>

<small>ALL LOST BUT&mdash;&mdash;</small></h2>


<p>Mr. Alec Feilding paced the thick carpet of his studio with a
restless step and an unquiet mind. Never before had he faced a
more gloomy outlook. Black clouds, storm and rain, everywhere.
Bad, indeed, is it for the honest tradesman when there is no money
left, and no credit. But a man can always begin the world again
if he has a trade. The devil of it is when a man has no trade at all,
except that of lying and cheating in the abstract. Many men, it is
true, combine cheatery and falsehood with their trade. Few are so
unfortunate as to have no trade on which to base their frauds and
adulterations.</p>

<p>Everything threatened, and all at once. Nay, it seemed as if
everything was actually taken from him and all at once. Not
something here, which might be repaired, and something there, a
little later on, but all at once&mdash;everything. Nothing at all left.
Even his furniture and his books might be seized. He would be
stripped of his house, his journal, his name, his credit, his position&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
his genius! Therefore his face&mdash;that face which Armorel
found so wooden&mdash;was now full of expression, but of the terror-stricken,
hunted kind: that of the man who has been found out
and is going to be exposed.</p>

<p>On the table lay three or four letters. They had arrived that
morning. He took them up and read them one after the other.
It was line upon line, blow upon blow.</p>

<p>The first was from Roland Lee.</p>

<p>'I see no object,' he said, 'in granting you the interview which
you propose. There is not really anything that requires discussion.
As to our interests being identical, as you say&mdash;if they have been
so hitherto they will remain so no longer. As to the market price
of the pictures, which you claim to have raised by your judicious
management, I am satisfied to see my work rise to its own level by
its own worth. As to your threat that the influence which has
been exerted for an artist may be also exerted against him&mdash;you
will do what you please. Your last demand, for gratitude, needs no
reply. I start again, exactly where I was when you found me. I
am still as poor and as little known. The half-dozen pictures
which you have sold as your own will not help me in any way.
Your assertion that I am about to reap the harvest of your labours
is absurd. I begin the world over again. The last picture&mdash;the
one now in your studio&mdash;you will be good enough not to exhibit'&mdash;'Won't
I, though?' asked the owner&mdash;'at the penalty of certain
inconveniences which you will learn immediately. I have torn up
and burned your cheque.'&mdash;'So much the better for me,' said the
purchaser.&mdash;'You say that you will not let me go without a personal
interview. If you insist upon one, you must have it. You
will find me here any morning. But, as you can only want an
interview in the hope of renewing the old arrangement, I am bound
to warn you that it is hopeless and impossible, and to beg that you
will not trouble yourself to come here at all. Understand that no
earthly consideration will induce me to bear any further share in
the deception in which I have been too long a confederate. The
guilty knowledge of the past should separate us as wide apart as
the poles. To see you will be to revive a guilty memory. Since
we must meet, perhaps, from time to time, let us meet as a pair of
criminals who avoid each other's conversation for fear of stirring
up the noisome past. What has been resolved upon, so far as I&mdash;and
another&mdash;are concerned, Miss Armorel Rosevean has undertaken
to inform you.&mdash;R. L.'</p>

<p>'Deception! Criminals!' I suppose there is no depth of
wickedness into which men may not descend, step by step, getting
daily deeper in the mire of falsehood and crime, yet walking always
with head erect, and meeting the world with the front of rectitude.
Had anyone told Mr. Alec Feilding, years before, what he would
do in the future, he would have kicked that foul and obscene
prophet. Well: he had done these things, and deliberately: he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
had posed before the world as painter, poet, and writer of fiction.
As time went on, and the world accepted his pretensions, they
became a part of himself. Nay: he even excused himself. Everybody
does the same thing: or, just the same, everybody would do
it, given the chance: it is a world of pretension, make-believe, and
seeming. Besides, he was no highwayman, he bought the things:
he paid for them: they were his property. And yet&mdash;'Deception!
Criminals!' The words astonished and pained him.</p>

<p>And the base ingratitude of the man. He was starving: no one
would buy his things: nobody knew his work, when he stepped in.
Then, by dexterity in the art of Puff, which the moderns call
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réclame</i>&mdash;he actually believed this, being so ignorant of Art&mdash;he
had forced these pictures into notice: he had run up their price,
until for that picture on the easel he had been offered, and had
taken, 450<i>l.</i>! Ungrateful!</p>

<p>'Deception! Criminals!'</p>

<p>Why, the man had actually received a cheque for 300<i>l.</i> for that
very picture. What more could he want or expect? True, he had
refused to cash the cheque. More fool he!</p>

<p>And now he was going absolutely to withdraw from the partnership,
and work for himself. Well&mdash;poor devil! He would starve!</p>

<p>He stood in front of the picture and looked at it mournfully.
The beautiful thing&mdash;far more beautiful than any he had exhibited
before. It cut him to the heart to think&mdash;not that he had been
such a fraud, but&mdash;that he could have no more from the same source.
His career was cut short at the outset, his ambitions blasted, by
this unlucky accident. Yet a year or two and the Academy would
have made him an Associate: a few more years and he would have
become R.A. Perhaps, in the end, President. And now it was
all over. No Royal Academy for him, unless&mdash;a thing almost desperate&mdash;he
could find some other Roland Lee&mdash;some genius as poor,
as reckless of himself. And it might be years&mdash;years&mdash;before he
could find such a one. Meantime, what was he to show? What
was he to say? 'Deception! Criminals!' Confound the fellow!
The words banged about his head and boxed his ears.</p>

<p>The second letter was from Effie&mdash;the girl to whom he had paid
such vast sums of money, whom he had surrounded with luxuries&mdash;on
whom he had bestowed the precious gift of his personal friendship.
This girl also wrote without the least sense of gratitude.
She said, in fact, writing straight to the point, 'I beg to inform
you that I shall not, in future, be able to continue those contributions
to your paper which you have thought fit to publish in two
volumes with your own name attached. I have submitted my
original manuscript of those verses to a friend, who has compared
them with your published volume, and has ascertained that there
is not the alteration of a single word. So that your pretence of
having altered and improved them, until they became your own, is
absurd. My brother begs me to add that your statement made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
before all the people at the reading was false. You made no suggestions.
You offered no advice. You said that the play was
worthless. My brother has made no alterations. You offered to give
him fifty pounds for the whole rights in the play, with the right of
bringing it out under your own name. This offer he refuses absolutely.</p>

<p>'I sincerely wish I could restore the money you have given me.
I now understand that it was the price of my silence&mdash;the Wages
of Sin.</p>

<p class="signature">
'E. W.'<br />
</p>

<p>No more verses from that quarter. Poets, however, there are
in plenty, writers of glib and flowing rhymes. To be sure, they
are as a race consumed by vanity, and want to have their absurd
names stuck to everything they do. Very well, henceforth he would
have anonymous verses, and engage a small army of poets. The
letter moved him little, except that it came by the same post as the
other. It proved, taken with the evening of the play, concerted
action. As for comparing the girl's manuscript verses with the
volume, how was she to prove that the manuscript verses were not
copied out of the volume?</p>

<p>Then there was a third letter, a very angry letter, from Lady
Frances, his story-teller.</p>

<p>'I learn,' she said, 'that you have chosen me as the fittest person
upon whom to practise your deceptions. You assured me that
you were engaged to Miss Armorel Rosevean. I learn from the
young lady herself that this is entirely false: you did offer yourself,
it is true, a week after you had assured me of the engagement.
You were promptly and decidedly refused. And you had no reason
whatever for believing that you would be accepted.</p>

<p>'I should like you to consider that you owe your introduction
into society to me. You also owe to me whatever name you have
acquired as a story-teller. Every one of the society stories told in
your paper has been communicated to you by me. And this is the
way in which you repay my kindness to you.</p>

<p>'Under the circumstances, I think you cannot complain if I
request that in future we cease to meet even as acquaintances. Of
course, my contributions to your paper will be discontinued. And
if you venture to state anywhere that they are your own work, I
will publicly contradict the statement.</p>

<p class="signature">
'F. H.'</p>

<p>He stood irresolute. What was to be done? For the moment
he could think of nothing. 'It is that cursed girl!' he cried.
'Why did she ever come here? By what unlucky accident did she
meet these two&mdash;Roland Lee and Effie? Why was I such a fool as
to ask Lady Frances to call upon her? Why did I send Zoe to her?
It is all folly together. If it had not been for her we should have
been all going on as before. I am certain we should&mdash;and going
on comfortably. I should have made Roland's fortune as well as
my own name&mdash;and his hand was getting stronger and better every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
day. And I should have kept that girl in comfort, and made a very
pretty little name for myself that way. She was improving, too&mdash;a
bright and clever girl&mdash;a real treasure in proper hands. And I
had the boy as well, or should have had. Good Heavens! what
losses! What a splendid possession to have destroyed! No man
ever before had such a chance&mdash;to say nothing of Lady Frances!'
It was maddening. We use the word lightly, and for small cause.
But it really was maddening. 'What will they say? What are
they going to do? What can they say? If it comes to a question
of affirmation I can swear as well as anyone, I suppose. If Roland
pretends that he painted my pictures&mdash;if Effie says she wrote my
poems&mdash;how will they prove it? What can they do?</p>

<p>'But things stick. If it is whispered about that there will be
no more pictures and no more poems&mdash;oh! it is the hardest luck.'</p>

<p>One more letter reached him by that morning's post:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>'Dearest Alec,&mdash;I have left Armorel, and am no longer a Companion.
The gilt could not disguise the pill. I have, however, a
communication to make of a more comfortable character than this.
It is true that I am like a housemaid out of a situation. But I
think you will change the natural irritation caused by this announcement
for a more joyful countenance when you see me. I shall
arrive with my communication about noon to-morrow. Be at home,
and be alone.&mdash;Your affectionate</p>

<p class="signature">
'<span class="smcap">Zoe</span>.'</p></blockquote>

<p>What had she got to say? At the present crisis what could it
matter what she had to say? If she had only got that money out
of Armorel, or succeeded in making the girl his servant. But she
could not do the only really useful thing he ever asked of her.</p>

<p>He laid down the letter on the table, beside one from his
printers&mdash;three days old. In this communication the printers
pointed out that his account was very large; that no satisfactory
arrangement had been proposed; that they were going to discontinue
printing his paper unless something practical was effected;
and that they hoped to hear from him without delay.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door: the discreet man-servant
brought a card, with the silence and confidential manner of one
who announces a secret emissary&mdash;say a hired assassin.</p>

<p>The visitor was Mr. Jagenal. He came in friendly and
expansive.</p>

<p>'My dear boy!' he said with a warm grasp. 'Always at work&mdash;always
at work?'</p>

<p>Alec dexterously swept the letters into an open drawer.
'Always at work,' he said. 'But I must be hard pressed when I
cannot give you five minutes. What is it?'</p>

<p>'I will come to the point at once. You know Mrs. Elstree very
well, I believe?'</p>

<p>'Very well indeed&mdash;I knew her before her father's failure.
Before her marriage.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>'Quite so. Then what do you make of this?' He handed over
a note, which the other man read: 'Dear Sir,&mdash;Unexpected circumstances
have made it necessary for me to give up my charge of
Armorel Rosevean at once. I have not even been able to wait a
single day. I have been compelled to leave her without even
wishing her farewell.&mdash;Very truly yours, Zoe Elstree.'</p>

<p>'It is very odd,' he said truthfully. 'I know nothing of these
circumstances. I cannot tell you why she has resigned.'</p>

<p>'Oh! I thought I would ask you! Well, she has actually gone:
she has vanished: she has left the girl quite alone. This is all very
irregular, isn't it? Not quite what one expects of a lady, is it?'</p>

<p>'Very irregular indeed. Well, I am responsible for her introduction
to you, and I will find out, if I can, what it means. She
is coming here to-day, she writes: no doubt to give me her reasons.
What will Miss Rosevean do?'</p>

<p>'Oh! she is an independent girl. She tells me that she has
found a young lady about her own age, and they are going to live
together. Alec, I don't quite understand why you thought Mrs.
Elstree so likely a person for companion. Philippa tells me that
she has no friends, and we appointed her because we thought she
had so many.'</p>

<p>'Pleasing&mdash;attractive&mdash;accomplished&mdash;what more did you want?
And as for friends, she must have had plenty.'</p>

<p>'But it seems she had none. Nobody has ever called upon her.
And she never went into any society. Are you sure that you were
not misled about her, my dear boy? I have heard, for instance,
rumours about her and the provincial stage.'</p>

<p>'Oh! rumours are nothing. I don't think I could have been
mistaken in her. However, she has gone. I will find out why.
As for Armorel Rosevean&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Alec&mdash;what a splendid girl! Was there no chance there for
you? Are you so critical that even Armorel is not good enough
for you?'</p>

<p>'Not my style,' he said shortly. 'Never mind the girl.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;there is one more thing, Alec&mdash;and a more pleasant subject&mdash;about
yourself. I want to ask you one or two questions&mdash;family
questions.'</p>

<p>'I thought you knew all about my family.'</p>

<p>'So I do, pretty well. However&mdash;this is really important&mdash;most
important. I wouldn't waste your time if it was not important.
Do you remember your great-aunt Eleanor Fletcher?'</p>

<p>'Very well. She left all her money to charities&mdash;Cat!'</p>

<p>'And your grandmother, Mrs. Needham?'</p>

<p>'Quite well. What is in the wind now? Has Aunt Eleanor
been proved to have made a later will in my favour?'</p>

<p>'You will find out in a day or two. Eh! Alec, you are a lucky
dog. Painter&mdash;poet&mdash;nothing in which you do not command
success. And now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now&mdash;what?'</p>

<p>'That I will tell you, my dear boy, in two or three days.
There's many a slip, we know, but this time the cup will reach
your lips.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' cried the young man, startled. 'Cup?
Do you mean to tell me that you have something&mdash;something
unexpected&mdash;coming to me? Something considerable?'</p>

<p>'If it comes&mdash;oh! yes, it is quite certain to come&mdash;very considerable.
You are your mother's only son, and she was an
only child, and her grandfather was one Robert Fletcher, wasn't
he?'</p>

<p>'I believe he was. There's a family Bible on the shelves that
can tell us.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever hear anything about the early life and adventures
of this Robert Fletcher?'</p>

<p>'No: he was in the City, I believe, and he left a good large
fortune. That is all.'</p>

<p>'That is all. That is all. Well, my dear boy, the strangest
things happen: we must never be surprised at anything. But be
prepared to-morrow&mdash;or next day&mdash;or the day after&mdash;to be agreeably&mdash;most
agreeably&mdash;surprised.'</p>

<p>'To the tune of&mdash;what? A thousand pounds, say?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. It may amount very nearly to as much&mdash;very
nearly&mdash;Ha! ha!&mdash;to nearly as much as that, I dare say&mdash;Ho!
ho!' He chuckled, and wagged his white head. 'Very nearly a
thousand pounds, I dare say.' He walked over to look at the
picture.</p>

<p>'Really, Alec,' he said, 'you deserve all the luck you get.
Nobody can possibly grudge it to you. This picture is charming.
I don't know when I have seen a sweeter thing. You have the
finest feeling for rock and sea-shore and water. Well, my dear boy,
I am very sorry that you haven't as fine a feeling for Armorel
Rosevean&mdash;the sweetest girl and the best, I believe, in the world.
Good-bye!&mdash;good-bye! till the day after to-morrow&mdash;the day after
to-morrow! It will certainly reach to a thousand&mdash;or very near.
Ho! ho! Lucky dog!'</p>

<p>Mr. Jagenal went away nodding and smiling. There are
moments when it is very good to be a solicitor: they are moments
rich in blessing: they compensate, in some measure, for those
other moments when the guilty are brought to bay and the thriftless
are made to tremble: they are the moments when the solicitor
announces a windfall&mdash;the return of the long-lost Nabob&mdash;the
discovery of a will&mdash;the favourable decision of the Court.</p>

<p>Alec sat down and seized a pen. He wrote hurriedly to his
printers: 'Let the present arrangements,' he said, continue unchanged.
I shall be in a position in two or three days to make a
very considerable payment, and, after that, we will start on a more
regular understanding.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Another knock, and again the discreet man-servant came in on
tiptoe. 'Lady refused her card,' he whispered.</p>

<p>The lady was none other than Armorel herself&mdash;in morning
dress, wearing a hat.</p>

<p>He bowed coldly. There was a light in her eyes, and a heightened
colour on her cheek, which hardly looked like a friendly call.
But that, of course, one could not expect.</p>

<p>'After our recent interview,' he said, 'and after the very
remarkable string of accusations which fell from your lips, I could
hardly expect to see you in my studio, Miss Rosevean.'</p>

<p>'I came only to communicate a resolution arrived at by my
friends Mr. Roland Lee and Miss Effie Wilmot.'</p>

<p>'From your friends Mr. Roland Lee and Miss Effie Wilmot?
May I offer you a chair?'</p>

<p>'Thank you. No. My message is only to tell you this. They
have resolved to let the past remain unknown.'</p>

<p>'To let the past remain unknown.' He tried to appear careless,
but the girl watched the sudden light of satisfaction in his
eyes and the sudden expression of relief in his face. 'The past
remain unknown,' he repeated. 'Yes&mdash;certainly. Am I&mdash;may I
ask&mdash;interested in this decision?'</p>

<p>'That you know best, Mr. Feilding. It seems hardly necessary
to try to carry it off with me&mdash;I know everything. But&mdash;as
you please. They agree that they have been themselves deeply to
blame: they cannot acquit themselves. Certainly it is a pitiful
thing for an artist to own that he has sold his name and fame in a
moment of despair.'</p>

<p>'It would be indeed a pitiful thing if it were ever done.'</p>

<p>'Nothing more, therefore, will be said by either of them as to
the pictures or poems.'</p>

<p>'Indeed? From what you have already told me: from the
gracious freedom of your utterances at the National Gallery, I
seem to connect those two names with the charges you then
brought. They refuse to bring forward, or to endorse, those
charges, then? Do you withdraw them?'</p>

<p>'They do not refuse to bring forward the charges. They have
never made those charges. I made them, and I, Mr. Feilding'&mdash;she
raised her voice a little&mdash;'I do not withdraw them.'</p>

<p>'Oh! you do not withdraw them? May I ask what your word
in the matter is worth unsupported by their evidence&mdash;even if
their evidence were worth anything?'</p>

<p>'You shall hear what my word is worth. This picture'&mdash;she
placed herself before it&mdash;'is painted by Mr. Roland Lee. Perhaps
he will not say so. Oh! It is a beautiful picture&mdash;it is quite the
best he has ever painted&mdash;yet. It is a true picture: you cannot
understand either its beauty or its truth. You have never been to
the place: you do not even know where it is: why, Sir, it is my
birthplace. I lived there until I was sixteen years of age: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
scene, like all the scenes in those pictures you call your own, was
taken in the Scilly archipelago.' He started. 'You do not even
know the girl who stands in the foreground&mdash;your own model.
Why&mdash;it is my portrait&mdash;mine&mdash;look at me, Sir&mdash;it is my portrait.
Now you know what my word is worth. I have only to stand
before this picture and tell the world that this is my portrait.'</p>

<p>He started and changed colour. This was unexpected. If the
girl was to go on talking in this way outside, it would be difficult
to reply. What was he to say if the words were reported to him?
Because, you see, once pointed out, there could be no doubt at all
about the portrait.</p>

<p>'A portrait of myself,' she repeated.</p>

<p>'Permit me to observe,' he said, with some assumption of
dignity, 'that you will find it very difficult to prove these statements&mdash;most
difficult&mdash;and at the same time highly dangerous,
because libellous.'</p>

<p>'No, not dangerous, Mr. Feilding. Would you dare to go into
a Court of Justice and swear that these pictures are yours? When
did you go to Scilly? Where did you stay? Under what circumstances
did you have me for a model? On what island did you
find this view?'</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>'Will you dare to paint anything&mdash;the merest sketch&mdash;to show
that this picture is in your own style? You cannot.'</p>

<p>'Anyone,' he said, 'may bring charges&mdash;the most reckless
charges. But I think you would hardly dare&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I will do this, then. If you dare to exhibit this picture as
your own, I will, most assuredly, take all my friends and stand in
front of it, and tell them when and where it was painted, and by
whom, and show them my own portrait.'</p>

<p>The resolution of this threat quelled him. 'I have no intention,'
he said, 'of exhibiting this picture. It is sold to an American,
and will go to New York immediately. Next year, perhaps,
I may take up your challenge.'</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully. 'I promised Roland,' she said, 'that
you should not show this picture. That is settled, then. You
shall not, you dare not.'</p>

<p>She left the picture reluctantly. It was dreadful to her to think
that it must go, with his name upon it.</p>

<p>On a side-table lay, among a pile of books, the dainty white-and-gold
volume of poems bearing the name of this great genius.
She took it up, and laughed.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said. 'Was there ever greater impudence? Every
line in this volume was written by Effie Wilmot&mdash;every line!'</p>

<p>'Indeed? Who says so?'</p>

<p>'I say so. I have compared the manuscript with the volume.
There is not the difference of a word.'</p>

<p>'If Miss Effie Wilmot, for purposes of her own, and for base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
purposes of deception, has copied out my verses in her own handwriting,
probably a wonderful agreement may be found.'</p>

<p>'Shame!' cried Armorel.</p>

<p>'You see the force of that remark. It <em>is</em> a great shame. Some
girls take to lying naturally. Others acquire proficiency in the
art. Effie, I suppose, took to it naturally. I am sorry for Effie.
I used to think better of her.'</p>

<p>'Oh! He tries, even now! How can you pretend&mdash;you&mdash;to
have written this sweet and dainty verse? Oh! You dare to put
your signature to these poems!'</p>

<p>'Of course,' said the divine Maker, with brazen front and
calmly dignified speech, 'if these things are said in public or outside
the studio, I shall be compelled to bring an action for libel.
I have warned you already. Before repeating what you have said
here you had better make quite sure that you can prove your
words. Ask Miss Effie Wilmot what proofs she has of her assertion,
if it is hers, and not an invention of your own!'</p>

<p>Armorel threw down the volume. 'Poor Effie!' she said.
'She has been robbed of the first-fruits of her genius. How dare
you talk of proofs?' She took up the current number of the
journal. 'That is not all,' she said. 'Look here! This is one
of your stories, is it not? I read in a paper yesterday that no
Frenchman ever had so light a touch: that there are no modern
stories anywhere so artistic in treatment and in construction as
your own&mdash;your own&mdash;your very own, Mr. Feilding. Yet they
are written for you, every one of them: they are written by Lady
Frances Hollington. You are a Triple Impostor. I believe that
you really are the very greatest Pretender&mdash;the most gigantic Pretender
in the whole world.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' he went on, a little abashed by her impetuosity.
'I cannot stop your tongue. You may say what you please.'</p>

<p>'We shall say nothing more. That is what I came to say on
behalf of my friends. I wished to spare them the pain of further
communication with you.'</p>

<p>'Kind and thoughtful!'</p>

<p>'I have one more question to ask you, Mr. Feilding. Pray,
why did you tell people that I was engaged to you?'</p>

<p>'Probably,' he replied, unabashed, 'because I wished it to be
believed.'</p>

<p>'Why did you wish it to be believed?'</p>

<p>'Probably for private reasons.'</p>

<p>'It was a vile and horrible falsehood!'</p>

<p>'Come, Miss Rosevean, we will not call each other names.
Otherwise I might ask you what the world calls a girl who encourages
a man to dangle after her for weeks, till everybody talks
about her, and then throws him over.'</p>

<p>'Oh! You cannot mean&mdash;&mdash;' Before those flashing eyes his
own dropped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>'I mean that this is exactly what you have done,' he said, but
without looking up.</p>

<p>'Is it possible that a man can be so base? What encouragement
did I ever give you?'</p>

<p>'You surely are not going to deny the thing, after all. Why,
it has been patent for all the world to see you. I have been
with you everywhere, in all public places. What hint did you
ever give me that my addresses were disagreeable to you?'</p>

<p>'How can one reply to such insinuations?' asked Armorel,
with flaming face. 'And so you followed me about in order to
be able to say that I encouraged you! What a man! What a
man! You have taught me to understand, now, why one man
may sometimes take a stick and beat another. If I were a man,
at this moment, I would beat you with a stick. No other treatment
is fit for such a man. I to encourage you!&mdash;when for a
month and more I have known what an Impostor and Pretender
you are! You dare to say that I have encouraged you!&mdash;you&mdash;the
robber of other men's name and fame!'</p>

<p>'Well, if you come to that, I do dare to say as much. Come,
Miss Armorel Rosevean. I certainly do dare to say as much.'</p>

<p>She turned with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>'I have said what I came to say. I will go.'</p>

<p>'Stop a moment!' said Alec Feilding. 'Is it not rather a bold
proceeding for a beautiful girl like you, a day or two after you have
refused a man, to visit him alone at his studio? Is it altogether
the way to let the world distinctly understand that there never has
been anything between us, and that it is all over?'</p>

<p>'I am less afraid of the world than you think. My world is my
very little circle of friends. I am very much afraid of what they
think. But it is on their account, and with their knowledge, that
I am here.'</p>

<p>'Alone and unprotected?'</p>

<p>'Alone, it is true. I can always protect myself.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!' He turned an ugly&mdash;a villanous&mdash;face towards her.
'We shall see! You come here with your charges and your fine
phrases. We shall see!'</p>

<p>He had been standing all this time before his study table. He
now stepped quickly to the door. The key was in the lock. He
turned it, drew it out, and dropped it in his pocket.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/i_273.jpg" width="365" height="600" alt="&#39;You have had your innings, and I am going to

<span class="caption"><i>&#39;You have had your innings, and I am going to

</div>

<p>'Now, my lovely lady,' he said, grinning, 'you have had your
innings, and I am going to have mine. You have come to this
studio in order to have a row with me. You have had that row.
You can use your tongue in a manner that does credit to your
early education. As for your nonsense about Roland Lee and Effie
and Lady Frances, no one is going to believe that stuff, you know.
As for your question, I did tell Lady Frances that you were
engaged to me. And I told others. Because, of course, you
were&mdash;or ought to have been. It was only by some kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
accident that I did not speak before. As I intended to speak the
next day, I anticipated the thing by twelve hours or so. What of
that? Well, I shall now have to explain that you seem not to
know your own mind. It will be awkward for you&mdash;not for me.
You have thrown me over. And all you have got to say in
explanation is a long rigmarole of abuse. This not my own painting?
These not my own poems? These, again, not my own
stories? Really, Miss Armorel Rosevean, you know so very little
of the world&mdash;you are so inexperienced&mdash;you are so easily imposed
upon&mdash;that I am inclined to pity rather than to blame you. Of
course, you have tried to do me harm, and I ought to be angry
with you. But I cannot. You are much too beautiful. To a
lovely woman everything, even mischief, is forgiven.'</p>

<p>'Will you open the door and let me go?'</p>

<p>'All in good time. When I please. It will do you no harm to
be caught alone in my studio&mdash;alone with me. It will look so like
returning to the lover whom, in a moment of temper, you threw
over. I will take care that it shall bear that interpretation, if necessary.
You have changed your mind, sweet Armorel, have you
not? You have repented of that cruel decision?'</p>

<p>He advanced a little nearer. I really believe that he was still
confident in his own power of subjugating the sex feminine&mdash;Heaven
knows why some men always retain this confidence.</p>

<p>Armorel looked round the room: the window was high, too high
for her to reach: there was no way of escape except through the
door. Then she saw something hanging on the wall within her
reach, and she took courage.</p>

<p>He drew still nearer: he held out his hands, and laughed.</p>

<p>'You are a really lovely girl,' he said. 'I believe there is not a
more beautiful girl in the whole world. Before you go let us make
friends and forgive. It is not too late to change your mind. I
will forget all you have said and all the mischief you have done me.
My man is very discreet. He will say nothing about your visit
here, unless I give him permission to speak. This I will never
allow unless I am compelled. Come, Armorel, once more let me be
your lover&mdash;once more. Give me your hands.'</p>

<p>He bowed suppliant. He looked in her face with baleful eyes.
He tried to take her hands. Armorel sprang from him and darted
to the other end of the room.</p>

<p>The thing she had observed was hanging up among the weapons
and armour and tapestry which decorated this wall of the studio.
It was an axe from foreign parts, I think, from Indian parts, with
a stout wooden handle and a boss of steel at the upper part.
Armorel seized this lethal weapon. It was so heavy that no ordinary
girl could have lifted it. But her arm, strengthened by a
thousand days upon the water, tugging at the oar, wielded it easily.</p>

<p>'Open the door!' she cried. 'Open the door this moment!'</p>

<p>Her wooer made no reply. He shrank back before the girl who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
handled this heavy axe as lightly as a paper-knife. But he did not
open the door.</p>

<p>'Open it, I say!'</p>

<p>He only shrank back farther. He was cowed before the wrath
in her face. He did not know what she would do next. I think
he even forgot that the key was in his pocket. The door, a dainty
piece of furniture, was not one of the common machine-made things
which the competitive German&mdash;or is it the thrifty Swede?&mdash;is so
good as to send over to us. It was a planned and fitted door, the
panels painted with reeds and grasses, the gift of some admirer of
genius. Armorel raised the axe&mdash;and looked at him. He did not
move.</p>

<p>Crash! It went through the panel. Crash! again and again.
The upper part of the door was a gaping wreck of splinters. Outside,
the discreet man-servant waited in silence and expectation.
Often ladies had held interviews alone with his master. But this
was the first time that an interview had ended with such a
crash.</p>

<p>'Will you open the door?' she asked again.</p>

<p>The man replied by a curse.</p>

<p>The lock&mdash;a piece of imitation mediævalism in iron&mdash;was fitted
on to the inner part of the door, a very pretty ornament. Armorel
raised her axe again, and brought the square boss at the top of it
down upon the dainty fragile lock, breaking it and tearing it from
the wood. There was no more difficulty in opening the door. She
did so. She threw the hatchet on the carpet and walked away, the
discreet man-servant opening the door for her with unchanged
countenance, as if the deplorable incident had not happened
at all.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII_2" id="CHAPTER_XXII_2"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE END OF WORLDLY TROUBLES</small></h2>


<p>Not more than five minutes afterwards, Mrs. Elstree arrived upon
this scene of wreck. The splintered panels, the broken lock, the
axe lying on the floor, proclaimed aloud that there had been an
Incident of some gravity&mdash;certainly what we have called a Deplorable
Incident.</p>

<p>Such a thing as a Deplorable Incident in such a place and with
such a man was, indeed, remarkable. Mrs. Elstree gazed upon
the wreck with astonishment unfeigned: she turned to the tenant
of the studio, who stood exactly where Armorel had left him. As
the sea when the storm has ceased continues to heave in sullen
anger, so that majestic spirit still heaved with wrath as yet unappeased.</p>

<p>In answer to the mute question of her eyes, he growled, and
threw himself into his study-chair. When she picked up the axe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and bore it back to its place, he growled. When she pointed to
the door, he growled again.</p>

<p>She looked at his angry face, and she laughed gently. The
last time we saw her she was pale and hysterical. She was now
smiling, apparently in perfect health of body and ease of mind.
Perhaps she was a very good actress&mdash;off the stage: perhaps she
shook off things easily. Otherwise one does not always step from
a highly nervous and hysterical condition to one of happiness and
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>'There appears to have been a little unpleasantness,' she said
softly. 'Something, apparently an axe&mdash;something hard and sharp&mdash;has
been brought into contact with the door. It has been
awkward for the door. There has been, I suppose, an earthquake.'</p>

<p>He said nothing, but drummed the table with his fingers&mdash;a
sign of impatient and enforced listening.</p>

<p>'Earthquakes are dangerous things, sometimes. Meanwhile,
Alec, if I were you I would have the broken bits taken away.'
She touched the bell on the table. 'Ford'&mdash;this was the name of
the discreet man-servant&mdash;'will you kindly take the door, which
you see is broken, off its hinges and send it away to be mended.
We will manage with the curtain.'</p>

<p>'What do you want, Zoe?'&mdash;when this operation had been
effected&mdash;'what is the important news you have to bring me?
And why have you given up your berth? I suppose you think I
am able to find you a place just by lifting up my little finger? And
I hear you have gone without a moment's notice, just as if you
had run away?'</p>

<p>'I did run away, Alec,' she replied. 'After what has&mdash;been
done'&mdash;she caught her breath&mdash;'I was obliged to run away. I
could no longer stay.'</p>

<p>'What has been done, then? Did Armorel tell you? No&mdash;she
couldn't.'</p>

<p>'She has told me nothing. I have hardly seen her at all during
the last few days. Of course, I know that you proposed to her&mdash;because
you went off with that purpose; and that she refused you&mdash;because
that was certain. And, now, don't begin scolding and
questioning, because we have got something much more important
to discuss. I have given up my charge of Armorel, and I have
come here. If you possibly can, Alec, clear up your face a little,
forget the earthquake, and behave with some attempt at politeness.
I insist,' she added sharply, 'upon being treated with some pretence
at politeness.'</p>

<p>'Mind, I am in no mood to listen to a pack of complaints and
squabbles and jealousies.'</p>

<p>'Whatever mind you are in, my dear Alec, it wants the sweetening.
You shall have no squabbles or jealousies. I will not
even ask who brought along the earthquake&mdash;though, of course,
it was an Angel in the House. They are generally the cause of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the earthquakes. Fortunately for you, I am not jealous. The
important thing about which I want to talk to you is money, Alec&mdash;money.'</p>

<p>Something in her manner seemed to hold out promise. A
drowning man catches at a straw. Alec lifted his gloomy face.</p>

<p>'What's the use?' he said. 'You have failed to get money in
the way I suggested. I haven't got any left at all. And we are
now at the very end. All is over and done, Zoe. The game is
ended. We must throw up the sponge.'</p>

<p>'Not just yet, dear Alec,' she said softly.</p>

<p>'Look here, Zoe'&mdash;he softened a little. 'I have thought over
things. I shall have to disappear for a while, I believe, till things
blow over. Now, here's just a gleam of luck. Jagenal the lawyer has
been here to-day. He came to tell me that he has discovered, somehow,
something belonging to me. He says it will run up to nearly a
thousand pounds. It isn't much, but it is something. Now, Zoe,
I mean to convert that thousand into cash&mdash;notes&mdash;portable property&mdash;and
I shall keep it in my pocket. Don't think I am going
to let the creditors have much of that! If the smash has to come
off, I will then give you half, and keep the other half myself.
Meantime, the possession of the money may stave off the smash.
But if it comes, we will go away&mdash;different ways, you know&mdash;and
own each other no more.'</p>

<p>'Not exactly, my dear Alec. You may go away, if you please,
but I shall go with you. For the future, I mean to go the same
way as you&mdash;with you&mdash;beside you.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' His face did not betray immoderate joy at this prospect.
'I suppose you have got something else to say. If that was
all, I should ask how you propose to pay for your railway ticket
and your hotel bill.'</p>

<p>'Of course, I have got something else to say.'</p>

<p>'It must be something substantial, then. Look here, Zoe:
this is really no time for fooling. Everything, I tell you, has
gone, and all at once. I can't explain. Credit&mdash;everything!'</p>

<p>'I have read,' said Zoe, taking the most comfortable chair and
lying well back in it, 'that the wise man once discovered that
everybody must be either a hammer or an anvil. I think it was
Voltaire. He resolved on becoming the hammer. You, Alec,
made the same useful discovery. You, also, became a hammer.
So far, you have done pretty well, considering. But now there is
a sudden check, and you are thrown out altogether.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'That seems to show that your plans were incomplete. Your
ideas were sound, but they were not fully developed.'</p>

<p>'I don't know you this morning, Zoe. I have never heard you
talk like this before.'</p>

<p>'You have never known me, Alec,' she replied, perhaps a little
sadly. 'You have never tried to know me. Well&mdash;I know all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Mr. Roland Lee, the painter, was one anvil&mdash;you played upon him
very harmoniously. Effie Wilmot was another. Now, Alec, don't'&mdash;she
knew the premonitory symptoms&mdash;'don't begin to deny,
either with the "D" or without, because, I assure you, I know
everything. You are like the ostrich, who buries his head in the
sand and thinks himself invisible. Don't deny things, because it
is quite useless. Before we go a step farther I am going to make
you understand exactly. I know the whole story. I have suspected
things for a long time, and now I have learned the truth. I
learned it bit by bit through the fortunate accident of living with
Armorel, who has been the real discoverer. First I saw the man's
work, and I saw at once where you got your pictures from, and
what was the meaning of certain words that had passed from
Armorel. Why, Armorel was the model&mdash;your model, and you
didn't know it. And the coast scenery is her scenery&mdash;the Scilly
Isles, where you have never been. I won't tell you how I pieced
things together till I had made a connected story and had no
longer any doubt. But remember the night of the Reading. Why
did Armorel hold that Reading? Why did she show the unfinished
picture? Why did she sing that song? It was for you, Alec. It
was to tell you a great deal more than it told the people. It was
to let you know that everything was discovered. Do you deny it
now?'</p>

<p>'I suppose that infernal girl&mdash;she is capable of everything&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Even of earthquakes? No, Alec, she has told me nothing.
They've got into the habit of talking&mdash;she and Effie and the painter
man&mdash;as if I was asleep. You see I lie about a good deal by the
fireside, and I don't want to talk, and so I lie with my eyes shut
and listen. Then Armorel leaves everything about&mdash;manuscript
poems, sketches, letters&mdash;everything, and I read them. A companion,
of course, must see that her ward is not getting into
mischief. It is her duty to read private letters. When they talk
in the evening, Effie, who worships Armorel, tells her everything,
including your magnificent attempt to become a dramatic poet, my
dear boy&mdash;wrong&mdash;wrong&mdash;you should not get more than one ghost
from one family. You should not put all your ghosts into one
basket. When the painter comes&mdash;Armorel is in love with him,
and he is in love with her; but he has been a naughty boy, and
has to show true repentance before.... Oh! It's very pretty
and sentimental: they play the fiddle and talk about Scilly and
the old times, and Effie sighs with sympathy. It is really very
pretty, especially as it all helped me to understand their ghostlinesses
and to unravel the whole story. Fortunately, my dear
Alec, you have had to do with a girl who is not of the ordinary
society stamp, otherwise your story would have been given to the
society papers long ago, and then even I could have done nothing
for you. Armorel is a girl of quite extinct virtues&mdash;forbearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
unrevengeful, honourable, unselfish. You, my dear Alec, could
never appreciate or understand such a girl.'</p>

<p>'The girl is&mdash;a girl. What is there to understand in one girl
more than in another?'</p>

<p>'Nothing&mdash;nothing. O great Poet and greater Painter!&mdash;Nothing.
O man of fine insight, and delicate fancy, and subtle
intellect!&mdash;Nothing. Only a girl.'</p>

<p>'I know already that they are not going to say anything more
about it. They are going to let the whole business be forgotten.
If anything comes out through you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nothing will come out. I told you because it is well that we
should perfectly understand each other. You will never again be
able to parade before me in the disguise of genius. This is a great
pity, because you have always enjoyed playing the part. Never
again, Alec, because I have found you out. Should you ever find
me out, I shall not be able to walk with you in the disguise of ...
but you must find out first.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Oh! you must find out first. When you do find out, you will
be able to hold out your arms and cry, "We are alike at last. You
have come down to my level: we are now in the same depths.
Come to my arms, sister in pretence! Come, my bride!"' She
spread out her arms with an exaggerated gesture and laughed, but
not mirthfully.</p>

<p>'What on earth do you mean, Zoe? I never saw you like this
before.'</p>

<p>'No, we change sometimes, quite suddenly. It is very unaccountable.
And now I shall never be anything else than what I
am now&mdash;what you have made me.'</p>

<p>'What have you done, then?'</p>

<p>'Done? Nothing. To do something is polite for committing
a crime. Could I have done something, do you think? Could I
actually commit a crime? O Alec!&mdash;my dear Alec!&mdash;a crime?
Well, the really important thing is that your troubles are over.'</p>

<p>'By Jove! They are only just beginning.'</p>

<p>'It is only money that troubles you. If it was conscience, or
the sense of honour, I could not help you. As it is only money&mdash;&mdash;how
much, actually, will put a period to the trouble?'</p>

<p>'If I were to use Jagenal's promised thousand, I could really
manage with two thousand more.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Then, my dear Alec, what do you think of this?'</p>

<p>She drew out of her pocket a new clean white bank-book, and
handed it to him.</p>

<p>He opened it. 'Heavens, Zoe! What is the meaning of
this?'</p>

<p>'You can read, Alec: it means what it says. Four thousand
two hundred and twenty-five pounds standing to my credit. Observe
the name&mdash;Mrs. Alexander Feilding&mdash;Mrs. Alexander Feilding&mdash;wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that is, of Alec! Mrs. Elstree has vanished. She has
gone to join the limbo of ghosts who never existed. Her adored
Jerome is there, too.'</p>

<p>'What does it mean?'</p>

<p>'It means, again, that I have four thousand two hundred and
twenty-five pounds of my own, who, the day before yesterday, had
nothing. Where I got that money from is my own business.
Perhaps Armorel relented and has advanced this money&mdash;perhaps
some old friends of my father's&mdash;he had friends, though he was
reputed so rich and died so miserably&mdash;have quietly subscribed this
amount&mdash;perhaps my cousins, whom you forced me to abandon,
have found me out and endowed me with this sum&mdash;a late but still
acceptable act of generosity&mdash;perhaps my mother's sister, who swore
she would never forgive me for going on the stage, has given way
at last! In short, my dear Alec&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Four thousand pounds! Where could you raise that money?'</p>

<p>'Make any conjecture you please. I shall not tell you. The
main point is that the money is here&mdash;safely deposited in my name
and to my credit. It is mine, you see, my dear Alec; and it can
only be used for your purposes with my consent&mdash;under my
conditions.'</p>

<p>'How on earth,' he repeated slowly, 'did you get four thousand
pounds?'</p>

<p>'It is difficult for you to find an answer to that question,' she
replied, 'isn't it? Especially as I shall not answer it. About my
conditions now.'</p>

<p>'What conditions?'</p>

<p>'The possession of this capital&mdash;I have thought it all out&mdash;will
enable us, first of all, to pay off your creditors in full if you must&mdash;or
at least to satisfy them. Next, it will restore your credit.
Thirdly, it will enable you to live while I am laying the foundations
of a new and more stable business.'</p>

<p>'You?'</p>

<p>'I, my dear boy. I mean in future to be the active working
and contriving partner in the firm. I have the plans and method
worked out already in my head. You struck out, I must say, a
line of audacity. There is something novel about it. But your
plan wanted elasticity. You kept a ghost. Well, I suppose
other people have done this before. You kept three or four
ghosts, each in his own line. Nobody thought of setting up as
the Universal Genius before&mdash;at least, not to my knowledge.
But, then, you placed your whole dependence upon your one
single family of ghosts. Once deprived of him&mdash;whether your
painter, your poet, your story-teller&mdash;and where were you? Lost!
You are stranded. This has happened to you now. Your paper is
to come out as usual, and you have got nothing to put into it.
Your patrons will be flocking to your studio, and you have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
nothing to show. You have made a grievous blunder. Now, Alec,
I am going to remedy all this.'</p>

<p>'You?'</p>

<p>'You shall see what I am capable of doing. You shall no
longer waste your time and money in going about to great houses.
Your wife shall have her <i>salon</i>, which shall be a centre of action
far more useful and effective. You shall become, through her
help, a far greater leader, with a far greater name, than you have
ever dreamed of. And your paper shall be a bigger thing.'</p>

<p>'You, Zoe? You to talk like this?'</p>

<p>'You thought I was a helpless creature because I never
succeeded on the stage, and could not even carry out your poor
little schemes upon Armorel's purse, I suppose, and because
I&mdash;&mdash; Well, you shall be undeceived.'</p>

<p>'If I could only believe this!'</p>

<p>'You will find, Alec, that my stage experiences will not go for
nothing. Why, even if I was a poor actress, I did learn the whole
business of stage management. I am going to transfer that business
from the stage to the drawing-room, which shall be, at first,
this room. We shall play our little comedy together, you and I.'
She sprang to her feet, and began to act as if she was on the
stage&mdash;'It will be a duologue. Your <i>rôle</i> will still be that of the
Universal Genius; mine will be that of the supposed extinct
Lady&mdash;the Lady of the Salon&mdash;I shall be at home one evening
a week&mdash;say on Sunday. And it shall be an evening remembered
and expected. We shall both take Art seriously: you as the
Master, I as the sympathetic and intelligent worshipper of Art.
We shall attract to our rooms artists of every kind and those who
hang about artistic circles: our furniture shall show the latest
artistic craze: foreigners shall come here as to the art centre
of London&mdash;we will cultivate the foreign element: young people
shall come for advice, for encouragement, for introduction: reputations
shall be made and marred in this room: you shall be the
Leader and Chief of the World of Art. If there is here and there
one who knows that you are a humbug, what matters? Alec'&mdash;she
struck a most effective attitude&mdash;'rise to the prospect! Have
a little imagination! I see before me the most splendid future&mdash;oh!
the most splendid future!'</p>

<p>'All very well. But there's the present staring us in the face.
How and where are we to find the&mdash;the successors to Lady Frances
and Effie and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Where to find ghosts? Leave that to me. I know where
there are plenty only too glad to be employed. They can be had
very cheap, my dear Alec, I can assure you. Oh! I have not been
so low down in the social levels for nothing. You paid a ridiculous
price for your ghosts&mdash;quite ridiculous. I will find you
ghosts enough, never fear.'</p>

<p>'Where are they?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>'When one goes about the country with a travelling company
one hears strange things. I have heard of painters&mdash;good
painters&mdash;who once promised to become Royal Academicians, and
anything you please, but took to ways&mdash;downward ways, you
know&mdash;and now sit in public-houses and sell their work for fifteen
shillings a picture. I will find you such a genius, and will make
him take pains and produce a picture worthy of his better days,
and you shall have it for a guinea and a pint of champagne.'</p>

<p>Alec Feilding gasped. The vista before him was too splendid.</p>

<p>'Or, if you want verses, I know of a poet who used to write
little dainty pieces&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levers de rideau, libretti</i> for little operettas,
and so forth. He carries the boards about the streets when he is
very hard up. I can catch that creature and lock him up without
drink till he has written a poem far better&mdash;more manly&mdash;than
anything that girl of yours could ever produce, for half-a-crown.
And he will never ask what becomes of it. If you want stories,
I know a man&mdash;quite a young fellow&mdash;who gets about fifteen
shillings a week in his travelling company. This fellow is wonderful
at stories. For ten shillings a column he will reel you out
as many as you want&mdash;good stuff, mind&mdash;and the papers have
never found him out: and he will never ask what has become
of them, because he is never sober for more than an hour or two
at a time in the middle of the day, and he will forget his own
handiwork. Alec, I declare that I can find you as many ghosts
as you like, and better&mdash;more popular&mdash;more interesting than your
old lot.'</p>

<p>'If I could only believe&mdash;&mdash;' he repeated.</p>

<p>'You say that because you have never even begun to believe
that a woman can do anything. Well, I do not ask you to believe.
I say that you shall see. I owe to you the idea. All the working
out shall be my own. All the assistance you can give me will
be your own big and important presence and your manner of
authority. Yes; some men get rich by the labours of others: you,
Alec, shall become famous&mdash;perhaps immortal&mdash;by the genius&mdash;the
collected genius, of others.'</p>

<p>His imagination was not strong enough to understand the vision
that she spread out before him. In a wooden way, he saw that
she intended something big. He only half believed it: he only
half understood it: but he did understand that ghosts were to be
had.</p>

<p>'There's next week's paper, Zoe,' he said helplessly. 'Nothing
for it yet! We mustn't have a breakdown&mdash;it would be fatal!'</p>

<p>'Breakdown! Of course not, even if I write it all myself.
You don't believe that I can write even, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Well, you shall do as you like.' He got up and stood over the
fire again, sighing his relief. 'At all events, we have got this
money. Good Heavens! What a chance! And what a day! I
stood here this morning, Zoe, thinking all was lost. Then old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Jagenal comes in and tells me of a thousand pounds&mdash;said it would
run to nearly a thousand. And then you come in with a bank-book
of four thousand! Oh! it's Providential! It's enough to
make a man humble. Zoe, I confess'&mdash;he took her hands in his,
stooped, and kissed her tenderly&mdash;'I don't deserve such treatment
from you. I do not, indeed. Are you sure about those ghosts?
As for me, of course you are right. I can't paint a stroke. I can't
make a rhyme. I can't write stories. I can do nothing&mdash;but live
upon those who can do everything. You are quite sure about
those ghosts?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! Quite sure. Of course I knew all along. But you
must keep it up more religiously than ever, because the business
is going to be so much&mdash;so very much&mdash;bigger. Now for my
conditions.'</p>

<p>'Any conditions&mdash;any!'</p>

<p>'You will insert this advertisement for six days, beginning
to-morrow, in the <i>Times</i>.'</p>

<p>He read it aloud. He read it without the least change of
countenance, so wooden was his face, so hard his heart.</p>

<blockquote><p>'On Wednesday, April 21, 1887, at St. Leonard's, Worthing,
Alexander Feilding, of the Grove Studio, Marlborough Road, to
Zoe, only daughter of the late Peter Evelyn, formerly of Kensington
Palace Gardens.'</p></blockquote>

<p>'I believe,' he said, folding the paper, 'that was the date. It
was three years ago, wasn't it? I say, Zoe, won't it be awkward
having to explain things&mdash;long interval, you know&mdash;engagement
as companion&mdash;wrong name?'</p>

<p>'I have thought of that. But it would be more awkward
pretending that we were married to-day and being found out. No.
There are not half-a-dozen people who will ever know that I was
Armorel's companion. Then, a circumstance, which there is no
need ever to explain, forbade the announcement of our marriage&mdash;hint
at a near relation's will&mdash;I was compelled to assume another
name. Cruel necessity!'</p>

<p>'You are a mighty clever woman, Zoe.'</p>

<p>'I am. If you are wise, now, you will assume a joyful air.
You will go about rejoicing that the bar to this public announcement
has been at length removed. Family reasons&mdash;you will say&mdash;no
fault of yours or of mine. It is your business, of course,
how you will look&mdash;but I recommend this line. Be the exultant
bridegroom, not the downcast husband. Will you walk so?'&mdash;she
assumed a buoyant dancing step with a smiling face&mdash;'or so?'
she hung a dejected head and crawled sadly.</p>

<p>'By gad, it's wonderful!' he cried, looking at her with
astonishment. And, indeed, who would recognise the quiet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
sleepy, indolent woman of yesterday in the quick, restless, and
alert woman of to-day?</p>

<p>'Henceforth I must work, Alec. I cannot sit down and go to
sleep any longer. That time has gone. I think I have murdered
sleep.'</p>

<p>'Work away, my girl. Nobody wants to prevent you. Are
there any other conditions?'</p>

<p>'You will sell your riding-horses and buy a Victoria. Your
wife must have something to drive about in. And you will lead,
in many respects, an altered life. I must have, for the complete
working out of my plans, an ideal domestic life. Turtle-doves we
must be for affection, and angels incarnate for propriety. The
highest Art in the home is the highest standard of manners that
can be set up.'</p>

<p>'Very good. Any more conditions?'</p>

<p>'Only one more condition. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'y suis. J'y reste.</i> You will call
your servant and inform him that I am your wife, and the mistress
of this establishment. I think there will be no more earthquakes
and broken panels. Alec'&mdash;she laid her hand upon his arm&mdash;'you
should have done this three years ago. I should have saved
you. I should have saved myself. Now, whatever happens, we
are on the same level&mdash;we cannot reproach each other. We shall
walk hand in hand. It was done for you, Alec. And I would
do it again. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. Again!' She repeated the words
with flashing eyes. 'Fraud&mdash;sham&mdash;pretence&mdash;these are our
servants. We command them. By them we live, and by them
we climb. What matter&mdash;so we reach the top&mdash;by what ladders
we have climbed?' She looked around with a gesture of defiance,
fine and free. 'The world is all alike,' she said. 'There
is no truth or honour anywhere. We are all in the same swim.'</p>

<p>The man dropped into his vacant chair. 'We are saved!' he
cried.</p>

<p>'Saved!' she echoed. 'Saved! Did you ever see a Court
of Justice, Alec? I have. Once, when our company was playing
at Winchester, I went to see the Assizes. I remember then wondering
how it would feel to be a prisoner. Henceforth I shall
understand his sensations. There they stand, two prisoners, side
by side&mdash;a man and a woman&mdash;a pair of them. Found out at last,
and arrested and brought up for trial. There sits the Judge, stern
and cold: there are the twelve men of the jury, grave and cold:
there are the policemen, stony-hearted: there are the lawyers,
laughing and talking: there are the people behind, all grave and
cold. No pity in any single face&mdash;not a gleam of pity&mdash;for the
poor prisoners. Some people go stealing and cheating because
they are driven by poverty. These people did not: they were
driven by vanity and greed. Look at them in the box: they are
well dressed. See! they are curiously like you and me, Alec'&mdash;she
was acting now better than she ever acted on the stage&mdash;'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
man is like you, and the woman&mdash;oh! you poor, unlucky
wretch!&mdash;is like me&mdash;curiously, comically like me. They will be
found guilty. What punishment will they get? As for her, it
was for her husband's sake that she did it. But, I suppose, that
will not help her. What will they get, Alec?'</p>

<p>He sat up in the chair and heaved a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'What are you talking about, my dear? I was not listening.
Well; we are saved. It has been a mighty close shave. Another
day, and I must have thrown up the sponge. We have a world of
work before us; but if you are only half or quarter as clever as
you think yourself, we shall do splendidly.' He laid his arm
round her waist, and drew her gently and kissed her again. 'So&mdash;now
you are sensible&mdash;what were you talking about prisoners
for? No more separations now. Let me kiss away these tears.
And now, Zoe&mdash;now&mdash;time presses. I am anxious to repair my
losses. Where are we to find these ghosts? Sit down. To
work! To work!'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII_2" id="CHAPTER_XXIII_2"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE HOUR OF TRIUMPH</small></h2>


<p>A man may do a great many things without receiving from the
world the least sign of regard or interest. He may write the most
lovely verses&mdash;and no one will read them. He may design and
invent the most beautiful play&mdash;which no one will act: he may
advocate a measure certain to bring about universal happiness&mdash;but
no one will so much as read it. There is one thing, however,
by which he may awaken a spirit of earnest curiosity and interest
concerning himself: he may get married. Everybody will read the
announcement of his marriage in the paper: everybody will immediately
begin to talk about him. The bridegroom's present position
and future prospects, his actual income and the style in which he
will live: the question whether he has done well for himself, or
whether he has thrown himself away: the bride's family, her age,
her beauty, her <i>dot</i>, if she has got any: the question whether she
had not a right to expect a better marriage&mdash;all these points are
raised and debated when a man is married. Also, which is even
more remarkable, whatever a man does shall be forgotten by the
world, but the story of his marriage shall never be forgotten. A
man may live down calumny; he may hold up his head though he
has been the defendant in a disgraceful cause; he may survive the
scandal of follies and profligacies; he may ride triumphant over
misfortune: but he can never live down his own marriage. All
those who have married 'beneath' them&mdash;whether beneath them
in social rank, in manners, in morals, character, in spiritual or in
mental elevation, will bear unwilling and grievous testimony to
this great truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>When, therefore, the <i>Times</i> announced the marriage of Mr.
Alexander Feilding, together with the fact that the announcement
was no less than three years late, great amazement fell upon all
men and all women&mdash;yea, and dismay upon all those girls who
knew this Universal Genius&mdash;and upon all who knew or remembered
the lady, daughter of the financial City person who let in
everybody to so frightful a tune, and then, like another treacherous
person, went away and hanged himself. And as many questions
were asked at the breakfast-tables of London as there were riddles
asked at the famous dinner-party at the town of Mansoul. To these
riddles there were answers, but to those none. For instance, why
had Alec Feilding concealed his marriage? Where had he hidden
his wife? And (among a very few) how could he permit her to go
about the country in a provincial troupe? To these replies there
have never been any answers. The lady herself, who certainly
ought to know, sometimes among her intimate friends alludes to
the cruelty of relations, and the power which one's own people
have of making mischief. She also speaks of the hard necessity,
owing to these cruelties, of concealing her marriage. This throws
the glamour and magic of romance&mdash;the romance of money&mdash;over
the story. But there are some who remain unconvinced.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The bridegroom wrote one letter, and only one, of explanation.
It was to Mr. Jagenal, the family solicitor.</p>

<p>'To so old a friend,' he wrote, 'the fullest explanations are
due concerning things which may appear strange. Until the day
before yesterday there were still existing certain family reasons
which rendered it absolutely necessary for us to conceal our
marriage and to act with so much prudence that no one should
so much as suspect the fact. This will explain to you why we
lent ourselves to the little harmless&mdash;perfectly harmless&mdash;pretence
by which my wife appeared in the character of a widow. It
also explains why she was unwilling&mdash;while under false colours&mdash;to
go into general society. The unexpected disappearance of
these family reasons caused her to abandon her charge hurriedly.
I had not learned the fact when you called yesterday. Now, I
hope that we may receive, though late, the congratulations of
our friends.&mdash;A. F.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'This,' said Mr. Jagenal, 'is an explanation which explains
nothing. Well, it is all very irregular; and there is something
behind; and it is no concern of mine. Most things in the world
are irregular. The little windfall of which I told him yesterday
will be doubly welcome now that he has a wife to spend his
money for him. And now we understand why he was always
dangling after Armorel&mdash;because his wife was with her&mdash;and why
he did not fall in love with that most beautiful creature.'</p>

<p>He folded up the note; put it, with a few words of his own,
into an envelope, and sent it to Philippa. Then he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
with the cases in his hands. Among these were the materials
for many other studies into the workings of the feminine heart
and the masculine brain. The solicitor's tin boxes: the doctor's
notebook: the priest's memory: should furnish full materials
for that exhaustive psychological research which science will some
day insist upon conducting.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day was the Private View of the
Grosvenor Gallery. There was the usual Private View crowd&mdash;so
private now that everybody goes there. It would have been
incomplete without the presence of Mr. Alec Feilding.</p>

<p>Now, at the very thickest and most crowded time, when the
rooms were at their fullest, and when the talk was at its noisiest,
he appeared, bearing on his arm a young, beautiful, and beautifully
dressed woman. He calmly entered the room where half the
people were talking of himself and of his marriage, concealed for
three years, with as much coolness as if he had been about in
public with his wife all that time: he spoke to his friends as if
nothing had happened: and he introduced them to his wife as
if it was by the merest accident that they had not already met.
Nothing could exceed the unconsciousness of his manner, unless
it was the simple and natural ease of his wife. No one could
possibly guess that there was, or could be, the least awkwardness
in the situation.</p>

<p>The thing itself, and the manner of carrying it through, constituted
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i> of the most brilliant kind. This public appearance
deprived the situation, in fact, of all its awkwardness. No one
could ask them at the Grosvenor Gallery what it meant. There
were one or two to whom the bridegroom whispered that it was a
long and romantic story: that there had been a bar to the completion
of his happiness, by a public avowal: that this bar&mdash;a
purely private and family matter&mdash;had only yesterday been removed:
nothing was really explained: but it was generally felt
that the mystery added another to the eccentricities of genius.
There was a something, they seemed to remember dimly, about
the marriages and love-passages of Shelley, Coleridge, and
Lord Byron.</p>

<p>Mrs. Feilding, clearly, was a woman born to be an artist's
wife: herself, artistic in her dress, her manner, and her appearance:
sympathetic in her caressing voice: gracious in her manners:
and openly proud of a husband so richly endowed.</p>

<p>Alec presented a great many men to her. She had, it seemed,
already made acquaintance with their works, which she knew by
name: she betrayed involuntarily, by her gracious smile, and the
interested, curious gaze of her large and limpid eyes, the genuine
admiration which she felt for these works, and the very great
pleasure with which she made the acquaintance of this very
distinguished author. If any of them were on the walls, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
bestowed upon them the flattery of measured and appreciative
praise: she knew something of the technique.</p>

<p>'Alec is not exhibiting this year,' she said. 'I think he is
right. He had but one picture: and that was in his old style.
People will think he can do nothing but sea-coast, rock, and
spray. So he is going to send his one picture away&mdash;if you want
to see it you must make haste to the studio&mdash;and he is going&mdash;this
is a profound secret&mdash;to break out in a new line&mdash;quite a new
line. But you must not know anything about it.'</p>

<p>A paragraph in a column of personal news published the fact,
the very next day, which shows how difficult it is to keep a secret.</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Feilding left the gallery she had made twenty
friends for life, and had laid a solid foundation for her Sunday
evenings.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a First Night. No First Nights are
possible without the appearance of certain people, of whom Mr.
Alec Feilding was one. He attended, bringing with him his wife.
Some of the men who had been at the private view were also
present at the performance, but not many, because the followers
of one art do not&mdash;as they should&mdash;rally round any other. But
all the dramatic critics were there, and all the regular first-nighters,
including the wreckers&mdash;who go to pit and gallery&mdash;and the
friends of the author and those of the actors. Between the acts
there was a good deal of circulation and talking. Alec presented
a good many more gentlemen to his wife. Before they went home
Mrs. Feilding had made a dozen more friends for life, and placed
her Sunday evenings on a firm and solid basis. Her social
success&mdash;at least among the men&mdash;was assured from this first
day.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV_2" id="CHAPTER_XXIV_2"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>THE CUP AND THE LIP</small></h2>


<p>Two days after the Private View Alec Feilding repaired, by
special invitation, to Mr. Jagenal's office.</p>

<p>'I have sent for you, Alec,' said the solicitor, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ami de famille</i>,
'in continuance of our conversation of the other day&mdash;about that
little windfall, you know.'</p>

<p>'I am not likely to forget it. Little windfalls of a thousand
pounds do not come too often.'</p>

<p>'They do not. Meantime another very important event has
happened. I saw the announcement in the paper, and I received
your note&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You are the only person&mdash;believe me&mdash;to whom I have
thought it right to explain the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes? The explanation, at all events, is one that may be
given in the same words&mdash;to all the world. I have no knowledge
of Mrs. Feilding's friends, or of any obstacles that have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
raised to her marriage! But I am rather sorry, Alec, that you
sent her to me under a false name, because these things, if they
get about, are apt to make mischief.'</p>

<p>'I assure you that this plan was only adopted in order the
more effectually to divert suspicion. It was with the greatest
reluctance that we consented to enter upon a path of deception.
I knew, however, in whose hands I was. At any moment I was in
readiness to confess the truth to you. In the case of a stranger
the thing would have been impossible. You, however, I knew,
would appreciate the motive of our action, and sympathise with the
necessity.'</p>

<p>Mr. Jagenal laughed gently&mdash;behind the specious words he
discerned&mdash;something&mdash;the shapeless spectre which suspicion calls
up or creates. But he only laughed. 'Well, Alec,' he said,
'marriage is a perfectly personal matter. You are a married man.
You had reasons of your own for concealing the fact. You are
now enabled to proclaim the fact. That is all anybody need
know. We condone the little pretence of the widowhood. Armorel
Rosevean has lost her companion; whether she has also lost
her friend I do not know. The rest concerns yourself alone.
Very good. You are a married man. All the more reason that
this little windfall should be acceptable.'</p>

<p>'It will be extremely acceptable, I assure you.'</p>

<p>'Whether it is money or money's worth?'</p>

<p>'To save trouble I should prefer money.'</p>

<p>'You must take it as it comes, my dear boy.'</p>

<p>'Well, what is it?'</p>

<p>'It is,' replied Mr. Jagenal solemnly, 'nothing short of the sea
giving up its treasures, the dead giving up her secrets, and the
restoration of what was never known to be lost.'</p>

<p>'You a maker of conundrums?'</p>

<p>'You shall hear. Before we come to the thing itself&mdash;the
treasure, the windfall, the thing picked up on the beach&mdash;let me
again recall to you two or three points in your own family history.
Your mother's maiden name was Isabel Needham. She was the
daughter of Henry Needham and Frances his wife. Frances was
the daughter of Robert Fletcher.'</p>

<p>'Very good. I believe that is the case.'</p>

<p>'Your money came to you from this Robert Fletcher, your
maternal great-grandfather. You should, therefore, remember
him.'</p>

<p>'I recognise,' said Alec, sententiously, 'the respect that should
be paid to the memory of every man who makes money for his
children.'</p>

<p>'Very good. Now, this Robert Fletcher as a young man, went
out to India in search of fortune. He was apparently an adventurous
young man, not disposed to sit down at the desk after the
usual fashion of young men who go out to India. We find him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Burmah, for instance&mdash;then a country little known by Englishmen.
While there he managed to attract the notice and the favour of
the King, who employed him in some capacity&mdash;traded with him,
perhaps; and, at all events, advanced his interests&mdash;so that,
while still a young man, he found himself in the possession of a
fortune ample enough for his wants&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Which he left to his daughters.'</p>

<p>'Don't be in a hurry. That was quite another fortune.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Another fortune? What became of the first?'</p>

<p>'Having enough, he resolved to return to his native country.
But in Burmah there were then no banks, merchants, drafts, or
cheques. He therefore converted his fortune into portable
property, which he carried about his person, no one, I take it,
knowing anything at all about it. Thus, carrying his treasure
with him, he sailed for England. Have you heard anything of
this?'</p>

<p>'Nothing at all. The beginning of the story, however, is
interesting.'</p>

<p>'You will enjoy the end still better. The ship in which he
sailed met with disaster. She was wrecked on the Isles of Scilly.
It is said&mdash;but this I do not know&mdash;that the only man saved from
the wreck was your great-grandfather: he was saved by one
Emanuel Rosevean, great-great-grandfather to Armorel, the girl
whose charge your own wife undertook.'</p>

<p>'Always that cursed girl!' murmured Alec.</p>

<p>'Robert Fletcher was clinging to a spar when he was picked up
and dragged ashore. He recovered consciousness after a long illness,
and then found that the leather case in which all his fortune
lay had slipped from his neck and was lost. Therefore, he had to
begin the world again. He went away, therefore. He went away&mdash;&mdash;'
Mr. Jagenal paused at this point, rattled his keys, and looked
about him. He was not a story-teller by profession, but he knew
instinctively that every story, in order to be dramatic&mdash;and he
wished this to be a very dramatic history&mdash;should be cut up into
paragraphs, illustrated by dialogue, and divided into sections.
Dialogue being impossible, he stopped and rattled his keys. This
meant the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.</p>

<p>'Do pray get along,' cried his client, now growing interested
and impatient.</p>

<p>'He went away,' the narrator repeated, 'his treasure lost, to
begin the world again. He came here, became a stockbroker,
made money&mdash;and the rest you know. He appears never to have
told his daughters of his loss. I have been in communication
with the solicitors of the late Eleanor Fletcher, your great-aunt,
and I cannot learn from them that she ever spoke of this calamity.
Yet had she known of it she must have remembered it. To bring
all your fortune&mdash;a considerable fortune&mdash;home in a bag tied
round your neck, and to lose it in a shipwreck is a disaster which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
would, one thinks, be remembered to the third and fourth generations.'</p>

<p>'I should think so. But you said something about the sea
giving up its treasure.'</p>

<p>'That we come to next. Five years ago, by the death of a
very aged lady, her great-great-grandmother, Armorel Rosevean
succeeded to an inheritance which turned out to be nothing less
than the accumulated savings of many generations. Among other
possessions she found in this old lady's room a sea-chest containing
things apparently recovered from wrecks, or drowned men, or
washed ashore by the sea&mdash;a very curious and interesting collection:
there were snuff-boxes, watches, chains, rings, all kinds of
things. Among these treasures she turned out, at the bottom of
the chest, a case of shagreen with a leather thong. On opening
this Armorel found it to contain a quantity of precious stones,
and a scrap of paper which seemed to show that they had formerly
been the property of one Robert Fletcher. We may suppose,
if we please, that the case containing the jewels was cast up on
the beach after the storm, and tossed into the chest without much
knowledge of its contents or their value. We may suppose that
Emanuel Rosevean found the case. We may suppose what we
please, because we can prove nothing. For my own part, I think
there is no reasonable doubt that the case actually contained the
fortune of Robert Fletcher. The dates of the story seem to correspond:
the handwriting appears to be his: we have letters of
his speaking of his intention to return, and of his property being
in convenient portable shape.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;then&mdash;this portable fortune belongs to Robert
Fletcher's heirs.'</p>

<p>'Not so quick. How are you going to prove your claim?
You have nothing to go by but a fragment of writing with part
of his name on it. You cannot prove that he was shipwrecked,
and if you could do that you could not prove that these jewels
belonged to him.'</p>

<p>'If there is no doubt, she ought to give them up. She is
bound in honour.'</p>

<p>'I said that in my mind there is no reasonable doubt. That is
because I have heard a great deal more than could be admitted in
evidence. But now&mdash;listen again without interrupting. When,
five years ago, the young lady placed the management of her
affairs in my hands through the Vicar of her parish, I had every
part of her very miscellaneous fortune valued and a part of it
sold. I had these rubies examined by a merchant in jewels.'</p>

<p>'And how much were they worth?'</p>

<p>'One with another&mdash;some being large and very valuable indeed,
and others small&mdash;they were said, by my expert, to be worth
thirty-five thousand pounds. They might, under favourable circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and if judiciously placed in the market realise much
more. Thirty-five thousand pounds!'</p>

<p>'What?' He literally opened his mouth. 'How much do
you say?'</p>

<p>'Thirty-five thousand pounds.'</p>

<p>'Oh! But the stones are not hers&mdash;they belong&mdash;they belong&mdash;to
us&mdash;to the descendants of Robert Fletcher.' No one would
have called that face wooden, now. It was full of excitement&mdash;the
excitement of a newly awakened hope. 'Does she propose to
buy me off with a thousand pounds? Does she think I am to be
bought off at any price? The jewels are mine&mdash;mine&mdash;that is, I
have a share in them.'</p>

<p>'Gently&mdash;gently&mdash;gently! What proof have you got of this
story? Nothing. You never heard of it: your great-grandfather
never spoke of it. Nothing would have been heard of it at all but
for this old lady from whom Armorel inherited. The property is
hers as much as anything else. If she gives up anything it is by
her own free and uncompelled will. She need give nothing.
Remember that.'</p>

<p>'Then she offers me a miserable thousand pounds for my share&mdash;which
ought to be at least a third. Jagenal'&mdash;he turned purple
and the veins stood out on his forehead&mdash;'That infernal girl hates
me! She has done me&mdash;I cannot tell you how much mischief.
She persecutes me. Now she offers to buy me out of my share of
thirty-five thousand pounds&mdash;a third share&mdash;nay&mdash;a half, because
my great-aunt left no children&mdash;for a thousand pounds down!'</p>

<p>'I did not say so.'</p>

<p>'You told me that the windfall would amount to a thousand
pounds.'</p>

<p>'That was in joke, my boy. You are perfectly wrong about
Armorel hating you. How can she hate you? You are so far
wrong in this instance that she has instructed me to give you the
whole of this fortune&mdash;actually to make you a free gift of the
whole property&mdash;the whole, mind&mdash;thirty-five thousand pounds!'</p>

<p>'To me! Armorel gives me&mdash;me&mdash;the whole of this fortune?'
Blank astonishment fell upon him. He stood staring&mdash;open-mouthed.
'To ME?' he repeated.</p>

<p>'To you. She does not, to be sure, know to whom she gives it.
She is only desirous of restoring the jewels which she insists in
believing to belong to Robert Fletcher's family. Therefore, as it
would be obviously impossible to find out and to divide this fortune
among all the descendants of Robert Fletcher, who are scattered
about the globe, she was resolved to give them to the eldest
descendant of the second daughter.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' Alec turned pale, and dropped into a chair, broken
up. 'To the eldest descendant of the second&mdash;the second daughter.
Then&mdash;&mdash;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>'Then to you, as the only grandson of the second daughter&mdash;Frances.'</p>

<p>'The second daughter was&mdash;&mdash;' He checked himself. He
sighed. He sat up. His eyes, always small and too close together,
grew smaller and closer together. 'The other branch of the
family,' he said slowly, 'has vanished&mdash;as you say&mdash;it is scattered
over the face of the globe. I do not know anything about my
cousins&mdash;if I have any cousins. Perhaps when you have carried on
the search a little further&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But I am not going to carry it on any further at all. Why
should I? We have nothing more to learn. I am instructed by
Armorel to give the rubies to you. It is a gift&mdash;not a right. It
is not an inheritance, remember&mdash;it is a free gift. She says,
"These rubies used to belong to Robert Fletcher. I will restore
them to someone of his kin." You are that someone. Why should
I inquire further?'</p>

<p>'Oh!' Alec sank back in his chair and closed his eyes as one
who recovers from a sharp pang, and sighed deeply. 'If you are
satisfied, then&mdash;&mdash; But if other cousins should turn up&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They will have nothing, because nobody is entitled to anything.
Come Alec, my boy, you look a little overcome. It is
natural. Pull yourself together, and look at the facts. You will
have thirty-five thousand pounds&mdash;perhaps a little more. At four
per cent.&mdash;I think I can put you in the way of getting so much
with safety&mdash;you will have fourteen hundred a year. You will
have that, apart from your literary and artistic income. It is not
a gigantic fortune, it is true; but let me tell you that it is a very
handsome addition indeed to any man's income. You will not be
able to live in Kensington Palace Gardens, where your wife lived
as a girl; but you can take a good house and see your friends,
and have anything in reason. Well, that is all I have to say,
except to congratulate you, which I do, my Alec'&mdash;he seized the
fortunate young man's hand and shook it warmly&mdash;'most heartily.
I do, indeed. You deserve your good luck&mdash;every bit of the good
luck that has befallen you. Everybody who knows you will
rejoice. And it comes just at the right moment&mdash;just when
you have acknowledged your marriage and taken your wife
home.'</p>

<p>'Really,' said Alec, now completely recovered, 'I am overwhelmed
with this stroke of luck. It is the most unexpected thing
in the world. I could never have dreamed of such a thing. To
find out, on the same day, that one's great-grandfather once made
a fortune and lost it, and that it has been recovered, and that it is
all given to me&mdash;it naturally takes one's breath away at first.'</p>

<p>'You would like to gaze upon this fortune from the Ruby
Mines of Burmah, would you not?' Mr. Jagenal threw open the
door of a safe, and took out a parcel in brown paper. 'It is here.'
He opened the parcel, and disclosed the shagreen case which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
have already seen in the sea-chest. He laid it on the table, and
unrolled the silk in which the stones were rolled. 'There they
are&mdash;look common enough, don't they? One seems to have picked
up stones twice as pretty on the sea-shore: here are two or three
cut and polished&mdash;bits of red glass would look as pretty.'</p>

<p>'Thirty-five thousand pounds!' Alec cried, laying a hand, as if
in episcopal benediction, upon the treasure. 'Is it possible that
this little bundle of stones should be worth so much?'</p>

<p>'Quite possible. Now&mdash;they are yours&mdash;what will you do with
them.'</p>

<p>'First, I will ask you to put them back in the safe.'</p>

<p>'I will send them to your bank if you please.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;keep them here&mdash;I will consult you immediately about
their disposition. Thirty-five thousand pounds! Thirty-five&mdash;&mdash;perhaps
we may get more for them. What am I to say to this
girl? Perhaps when she learns who has got the rubies she will
refuse to let them go. I am sure she would never consent.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense&mdash;about persecution and annoyance! Armorel hate
you? Why should she hate you? The sweetest girl in the world.
You men of genius are too ready to take offence. The things are
yours. I have given them to you by her instructions. I have
written you a letter, formally conveying the jewels to you. Here
it is. And now go home, my dear fellow, and when you feel like
taking a holiday, do it with a tranquil mind, remembering that
you've got fourteen hundred pounds a year given you for nothing
at all by this young lady, who wasn't obliged to give you a penny.
Why, in surrendering these jewels, she has surrendered a good
half of her whole fortune. Find me another girl, anywhere, who
would give up half her fortune for a scruple. And now go away,
and tell your wife. Let her rejoice. Tell her it is Armorel's
wedding present.'</p>

<p>Alec Feilding walked home. He was worth thirty-five thousand
pounds&mdash;fourteen hundred pounds a year. When one comes
to think of it, though we call ourselves such a very wealthy
country, there are comparatively few, indeed, among us who can
boast that they enjoy an income of fourteen hundred pounds a
year, with no duties, responsibilities, or cares about their income&mdash;and
with nothing to do for it. Fourteen hundred pounds a year
is not great wealth; but it will enable a man to keep up a very
respectable style of living: many people in society have got to live
on a great deal less. He and his wife were going to live on nothing
a year, except what they could get by their wits. Fourteen hundred
a year! They could still exercise their wits: that is to say,
he should expect his wife, now the thinking partner, to exercise
her wits with zeal. But what a happiness for a man to feel that
he does not live by his wits alone! Alas! It is a joy that is given
to few indeed of us.</p>

<p>As for his late literary and artistic successes, how poor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
paltry did they appear to this man, who had no touch of the artist
nature, beside this solid lump of money, worth all the artistic or
poetic fame that ever was achieved!</p>

<p>He went home dancing. He was at peace with all mankind.
He found it in his heart to forgive everybody: Roland Lee, who
had so basely deserted him: Effie, that snake in the grass: Lady
Frances, the most treacherous of women: Armorel herself&mdash;&mdash; Oh!
Heavens! what could not be forgiven to the girl who had
made him such a gift? Even the revolt against his authority:
even the broken panel, the shattered lock, and the earthquake.</p>

<p>In this mood he arrived home. His wife, the thinking partner,
was hard at work in the interests of the new firm. In her hand
was a manuscript volume of verse: on the table beside her lay an
open portfolio of sketches and drawings.</p>

<p>'You see, Alec,' she looked up, smiling. 'Already the ghosts
have begun to appear at my call. If you ask me where I found
them, I reply, as before, that when one travels about with a
country company one has opportunities. All kinds of queer people
may be heard of. Your ghosts, in future, my dear boy, must be
of the tribe which has broken down and given in, not of those
who are still young and hopeful. I have found a man who can
draw&mdash;here is a portfolio full of his things: in black and white:
they can be reproduced by some photographic process: he is in
an advanced stage of misery, and will never know or ask what
becomes of his things. He ought to have made his fortune long
ago. He hasn't, because he is always drunk and disreputable.
It will do you good to illustrate the paper with your own drawings.
There's a painter I have heard of. He drinks every afternoon
and all the evening at a certain place, where you must go and find
him. He has long since been turned out of every civilised kind
of society, and you can get his pictures for anything you like; he
can't draw much, I believe, but his colouring is wonderful. There
is an elderly lady, too, of whom I have heard. She can draw,
too, and she's got no friends, and can be got cheap. And this book
is full of the verses of a poor wretch who was once a rising literary
man, and now carries a banner at Drury-Lane Theatre whenever
they want a super. As for your stories, I have got a broken-down
actor&mdash;he writes better than he can act&mdash;to write stories of the
boards. They will appear anonymously, and if people attribute them
to you he will not be able to complain. Oh, I know what I am about,
Alec! Your paper shall double its circulation in a month, and shall
multiply its circulation by ten in six months, and without the least
fear of such complications as have happened lately. They must
lie avoided for the future&mdash;proposals as well as earthquakes&mdash;my
dear Alec.'</p>

<p>Alec sat down on the table and laughed carelessly. 'Zoe,' he
said, 'you are the cleverest woman in the world. It was a lucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
day for us both when you came here. I made a big mistake for
three years. Now I've got some news for you&mdash;good news&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That can only mean&mdash;money.'</p>

<p>'It does mean&mdash;money, as you say. Money, my dear. Money
that makes the mare to go.'</p>

<p>'How much, Alec?'</p>

<p>'More than your four thousand. Twenty times as much as that
little balance in your book.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Alec! is it possible? Twenty times as much? Eighty
thousand pounds?'</p>

<p>'About that sum,' he replied, exaggerating with the instincts
of the City, inherited, no doubt, from Robert Fletcher. 'Perhaps
quite that sum if I manage certain sales cleverly.'</p>

<p>'Is it a legacy?&mdash;or an inheritance?&mdash;how did you get it?'</p>

<p>'It is not exactly a legacy: it is a kind of restoration to an
unknown person: a gift not made to me personally, but to me
unknown.'</p>

<p>'You talk to me in riddles, Alec.'</p>

<p>'I would talk in blank verse if I could. It is, indeed, literally
true. I have received an&mdash;estate&mdash;in portable property worth
nearly forty thousand pounds.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Then we shall be really rich, and not have to pretend
quite so much? A little pretence, Alec, I like. It makes me
feel like returning to society: too much pretence reminds one of
the policeman.'</p>

<p>'Don't you want to know how I have come into this money?'</p>

<p>'I am not curious, Alec. I like everything to be done for me.
When I was a girl there were carriages and horses and everything
that I wanted&mdash;all ready&mdash;all done for me, you know. Then I was
stripped of all. I had nothing to do or to say in the matter. It
was done for me. Now, you tell me you have got eighty thousand
pounds. Oh! Heavens! It is done for me. The ways of fate
are so wonderful. Things are given and things are taken away.
Why should I inquire how things come? Perhaps this will be
taken away in its turn.'</p>

<p>'Not quite, Zoe. I have got my hand over it. You can trust
your husband, I think, to keep what he has got.' Indeed, he
looked at this moment cunning enough to be trusted with keeping
the National Debt itself.</p>

<p>'Eighty thousand pounds!' she said. 'Let me write it down.
Eighty thousand pounds! Eight and one, two, three, four oughts.'
She wrote them down, and clasped her hands, saying, 'Oh! the
beauty&mdash;the incomparable beauty&mdash;of the last ought!'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not quite so much,' said her husband, thinking that
the exaggeration was a little too much.</p>

<p>'Don't take off one of my oughts&mdash;not my fourth: not my
Napoleon of oughts!'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no. Keep your four oughts. Well, my dear, if it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
only sixty thousand or so, there is two thousand a year for us.
Two thousand a year!'</p>

<p>'Don't, Alec; don't! Not all at once. Break it gently.'</p>

<p>'We will carry on the paper; and perhaps do something or
other&mdash;carefully, you know&mdash;in Art. There is no need to knock
things off. And if you can make the paper succeed, as you think,
there will be so much the more. Well, we can use it all. For my
part, Zoe, my dear, I don't care how big the income is. I am
equal to ten thousand.'</p>

<p>'Of course, and you will still pronounce judgments and be a
leader. Now let us talk of what we will do&mdash;where we will live&mdash;and
all. Two thousand is pretty big to begin with, after three
years' tight fit; but the paper will bring in another two thousand
easily. I've been looking through the accounts&mdash;bills and returns&mdash;and
I am sure it has been villanously managed. We will run it
up: we will have ten thousand a year to spend. A vast deal may
be done with ten thousand a year: we will have a big weekly
dinner as well as an At Home. We will draw all the best people
in London to the house: we will&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She enlarged with great freedom on what could be done with
this income: she displayed all the powers of a rich imagination:
not even the milkmaid of the fable more largely anticipated the
joys of the future.</p>

<p>'And, oh! Alec,' she cried. 'To be rich again! rich only to
the limited extent of ten thousand a year, is too great happiness.
When my father was ruined, I thought the world was ended.
Well, it was ended for me, because you made me leave it and
disappear. The last four years I should like to be clean forgotten
and driven out of my mind&mdash;horrid years of failing and enduring
and waiting! And now we are rich again! Oh! we are rich
again! It is too much happiness!'</p>

<p>The tears rose to her eyes; her soft and murmuring voice
broke.</p>

<p>'My poor Zoe,' her husband laid his hand on hers, 'I am
rejoiced,' he said, 'as much for your sake as for my own.'</p>

<p>'How did you get this wonderful fortune, Alec?'</p>

<p>'Through Mr. Jagenal, the lawyer. It's a long story. A
great-grandfather of mine was wrecked, and lost his property.
That was eighty years ago. Now, his property was found. Who
do you think found it? Armorel Rosevean. And she has restored
it&mdash;to me.'</p>

<p>'What?' She sprang to her feet, her face suddenly turning
white. 'What? Armorel?'</p>

<p>'Yes, certainly. Curious coincidence, isn't it? The very girl
who has done me so much mischief. The man was wrecked on the
island where her people lived.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. The property&mdash;what was it? What was it?
Quick!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>'It was a leather case filled with rubies&mdash;rubies worth at least
thirty-five thousand pounds&mdash;&mdash; What's the matter?'</p>

<p>'Rubies! Her rubies! Oh! Armorel's rubies! No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;not
that! Anything&mdash;anything but that! Armorel's rubies&mdash;Armorel's
rubies!'</p>

<p>'What is the matter, Zoe? What is it?'</p>

<p>She gasped. Her eyes were wild: her cheek was white. She
was like one who is seized with some sudden horrible and unintelligible
pain. Or she was like one who has suddenly heard the
most dreadful and most terrible news possible.</p>

<p>'What is it, Zoe?' her husband asked again.</p>

<p>'You? Oh! you have brought me this news&mdash;you! I thought,
perhaps, someone&mdash;Armorel&mdash;or some other might find me out.
But you!&mdash;you!'</p>

<p>'Again, Zoe'&mdash;he tried to be calm, but a dreadful doubt seized
him&mdash;'what does this mean?'</p>

<p>'I remember,' she laughed wildly, 'what I said when I gave
you the bank-book. If you found me out, I said, we should be
both on the same level. You would be able to hold out your
arms, I said, and to cry, "You have come down to my level.
Come to my heart, sister in wickedness." That is what I said.
Oh! I little thought&mdash;it was a prophecy&mdash;my words have come
true.'</p>

<p>She caught her head with her hand&mdash;it is a stagey gesture:
she had learned it on the stage: yet at this moment of trouble it
was simple and natural.</p>

<p>'What the <span class="smcap">Devil</span> do you mean?' he cried with exasperation.</p>

<p>'They were <em>your</em> rubies all the time, and I did not know.
Your rubies! If I had only known! Oh! what have I done?
What have I done?</p>

<p>'Tell me quick, what you have done.' He caught her by
the arm roughly. He actually shook her. His own face now
was almost as white as hers. 'Quick&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell
me!'</p>

<p>'You wanted money badly,' she gasped. Her words came
with difficulty. 'You told me so every time I saw you. It was
to get money that I went to live with Armorel. I could not
get it in that way. But I found another way. She told me about
the rubies. I knew where they were kept. In the bank. In
a sealed packet. I had seen an inventory of the things in the
bank. Armorel told me the story of the rubies, and I never
believed it&mdash;I never thought that there would be any search for
the man's heirs. I never thought the story was true. She told
me, besides, all about her other things&mdash;her miniatures and snuff-boxes,
and watches and rings. She showed me all her beautiful
lace, worth thousands. And as for the gold things and the jewels,
they were all in the bank, in separate sealed parcels, numbered.
She showed me the bank receipts. Opposite each number was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
written the contents of each, and opposite Number Three was
written "The case containing the rubies."'</p>

<p>'Well? Well?'</p>

<p>'Hush! What did I do? Let me think. I am going mad,
I believe. It was for your sake&mdash;all for your sake, Alec! All for
your sake that I have ruined you!'</p>

<p>'Ruined me? Quick! What have you done?'</p>

<p>'It was for your sake, Alec&mdash;all for your sake! Oh, for your
own sake I have lost and ruined you!'</p>

<p>'You will drive me mad, I think!' he gasped.</p>

<p>'I wrote a letter, one day, to the manager of the bank. I
wrote it in imitation of Armorel's hand. I signed her name at
the end so that no one could have told it was a forgery. My
letter told him to give the sealed packet numbered three to the
bearer who was waiting. I sent the letter by a commissionaire.
He returned bringing the packet with him.'</p>

<p>'And then?'</p>

<p>'Oh! Then&mdash;then&mdash;Alec, you will kill me&mdash;you will surely kill
me when you know! You care for nothing in the world but for
money&mdash;and I&mdash;I have stolen away your money! It is gone&mdash;it is
gone!'</p>

<p>'You stole those rubies? But I have seen them. They are in
Jagenal's safe. What do you mean?' he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>'I have sold them. I stole them, and I sold them all&mdash;they
were worth&mdash;how much did you say? Fifty&mdash;sixty&mdash;eighty
thousand pounds? I sold them all, Alec, for four thousand two
hundred and twenty-five pounds! I sold them to a Dutchman in
Hatton Garden.'</p>

<p>'You are raving mad! You dream! I have seen them. I
have handled them.'</p>

<p>'What you have seen were the worthless imitation jewels that
I substituted. I found out where to get sham rubies made of
paste, or something&mdash;some cut and some uncut. I bought them,
and I substituted them in the case. Then I returned the packet
to the bank. I had the packet in my possession no more than one
morning. The man who bought the stones swore they were worth
no more. He said he should lose money by them: he was going
away to America immediately, and wanted to settle at once,
otherwise he would not give so much. That is what I have done,
Alec.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' he stood over her, his eyes glaring; he roared like a
wild beast; he raised his hand as if to slay her with a single blow.
But he could find no words. His hand remained raised&mdash;he was
speechless&mdash;he was motionless&mdash;he was helpless with blind rage
and madness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_301.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="His hand remained raised&mdash;he was speechless&mdash;he was motionless&mdash;he was

<span class="caption"><i>His hand remained raised&mdash;he was speechless&mdash;he was motionless&mdash;he was
helpless with blind rage and madness.</i></span>
</div>

<p>His wife looked up, and waited. Now that she had told her
tale she was calm.</p>

<p>'If you are going to kill me,' she said, 'you had better do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
at once. I think I do not care about living any longer. Kill me,
if you like.'</p>

<p>He dropped his arm: he straightened himself, and stood
upright.</p>

<p>'You are a Thief!' he said hoarsely. 'You are a wretched,
miserable <span class="smcap">Thief</span>!'</p>

<p>She pointed to the picture on the easel.</p>

<p>'And you&mdash;my husband?'</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair. Then he got up and paced the
room: he beat the air with his hands: his face was distorted: his
eyes were wild: he abandoned himself to one of those magnificent
rages of which we read in History. William the Conqueror&mdash;King
Richard&mdash;King John&mdash;many mediæval kings used to fall
into these rages. They are less common of late. But then such
provocation as this is rare in any age.</p>

<p>When, at last, speech came to him, it was at first stuttering
and broken: speech of the elementary kind: speech of primitive
man in a rage: speech ejaculatory: speech interjectional: speech
of railing and cursing. He walked&mdash;or, rather, tramped&mdash;about
the room: he stamped with his foot: he banged the table with
his fist: he roared: he threatened: he cleared the dictionary of
its words of scorn, contempt, and loathing: he hurled all these
words at his wife. As a tigress bereft of her young, so is such a
man bereft of his money.</p>

<p>His wife, meantime, sat watching, silent. She waited for the
storm to pass. As for what he said, it was no more than the
rolling of thunder. She made no answer to his reproaches; but
for her white face you would have thought she neither heard nor
felt nor cared.</p>

<p>Outside the discreet man-servant heard every word. Once,
when his master threatened violence, he thought it might be his
duty to interfere. As the storm continued, he began to feel that
this was no place for a man-servant who respected himself. He
remembered the earthquake. He had then been called upon to
remove from its hinges a door fractured in a row. That was a
blow. He was now compelled to listen while a master, unworthy
of such a servant, brutally swore at his wife. He perceived that
his personal character and his dignity no longer allowed him to
remain with such a person. He resigned, therefore, that very
day.</p>

<p>When the bereaved sufferer could say no more&mdash;for there comes
a time when even to shriek fails to bring relief&mdash;he threw himself
into a chair and began to cry. Yes: he cried like a child: he
wept and sobbed and lamented. The tears ran down his cheeks:
his voice was choked with sobs. The discreet man-servant outside
blushed with shame that such a thing should happen under his
roof. The wife looked on without a sign or a word. We break
down and cry when we have lost the thing which most we love&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
may be a wife; it may be a child: in the case of this young man
the thing which most he loved and desired was money. It had
been granted to him&mdash;in large and generous measure. And, lo!
it was torn from his hands before his fingers had even closed
around it. Oh! the pity&mdash;the pity of it!</p>

<p>This fit, too, passed away.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when he was quite quiet, exhausted with
his rage, his wife laid her hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>'Alec,' she said, 'I have always longed for one thing most of
all. It was the only thing, I once thought, that made it worth the
trouble to live. An hour ago it seemed that the thing had been
granted to me. And I was happy even with this guilt upon my
soul. I know you for what you are. Yet I desired your love.
Henceforth, this dreadful thing stands between us. You can no
longer love me&mdash;that is certain, because I have ruined you&mdash;any
more than I can hold you in respect. Yet we will continue to
walk together&mdash;hand in hand&mdash;I will work and you shall enjoy.
If we do not love each other, we can continue in partnership, and
show to the world faces full of affection. At least you cannot
reproach me. I am a thief, it is true&mdash;most true! And you&mdash;Alec!
you&mdash;oh! my husband!&mdash;what are you?'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV_2" id="CHAPTER_XXV_2"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>TO FORGET IT ALL</small></h2>


<p>When Philippa read the announcement in the <i>Times</i>, she held her
breath for a space. It was at breakfast. Her father was reading
the news; she was looking through that column which interests us
all more than any other. Her eye fell upon her cousin's name.
She read, she changed colour, she read again. Her self-control
returned. She laid down the paper. 'Here,' she said, 'is a very
astonishing announcement!' A very astonishing announcement
indeed!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>An hour later she called upon Armorel at her rooms.</p>

<p>'You are left quite alone in consequence of this&mdash;this amazing
revelation?'</p>

<p>'Quite. Not that I mind being alone. And Effie Wilmot is
coming.'</p>

<p>'Nothing in the world,' said Philippa, 'could have astonished
me more. It is not so much the fact of the marriage&mdash;indeed, my
cousin's name was mentioned at one time a good deal in connection
with hers&mdash;but the dreadful duplicity. He sent her to you&mdash;she
came to us&mdash;as a widow. And for three years they have been
married! Is it possible?'</p>

<p>'Indeed,' said Armorel, 'I know nothing. She left me without
a cause, and now I hear of her marriage. That is all.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>'My dear, the thing reflects upon us. It is my cousin who has
brought this trouble upon you.'</p>

<p>'Oh! no, Philippa! As if you could be held responsible for
his actions! And, indeed, you must not speak of trouble. I have
had none. My companion was never my friend in any sense: we
had nothing in common: we must have parted company very soon:
she irritated me in many ways, especially in her blind praise of the
man who now turns out to be her husband. I really feel much
happier now that she has gone.'</p>

<p>'But you have no companion&mdash;no chaperon.'</p>

<p>'I don't want any chaperon, I assure you.'</p>

<p>'But you cannot go into society alone.'</p>

<p>'I never do go into society. You know that nobody ever called
upon Mrs. Elstree&mdash;or Mrs. Feilding, as we must now call her.
There are only two houses in the whole of this great London into
which I have found an entrance&mdash;yours and Mr. Jagenal's.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I know now. And most disgraceful it is that you should
have been so sacrificed. That also is my cousin's doing. He represented
his wife&mdash;it seems difficult to believe that he has got a wife&mdash;as
a person belonging to a wide and very desirable circle of friends.
Not a soul called upon her! The world cannot continue to know
a woman who has disappeared bodily for three long years, during
which she was reported to have been seen on the stage of a country
theatre. What has she been doing? Why has she been in hiding?
It was culpable negligence in Mr. Jagenal not to make inquiries.
What it must be called in my cousin others may determine. As
for you, Armorel, you have been most disgracefully and shamefully
treated.'</p>

<p>'I suppose I ought to have had a companion who was recognised
by society. But it seems to matter very little. I have made one
or two new friends, and I have found an old friend.'</p>

<p>'It is not too late, of course, even for this season. Now, my
dear Armorel, I am charged with a mission. It is to bring you
back with me&mdash;to get you to stay with us for the season and, at
least, until the summer holidays. That is, if you would be satisfied
with our friends.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Philippa, a thousand times. I do not think I can
accept your kindness, however, because I feel as if I must go away
somewhere. I have had a great deal of anxiety and worry. It has
been wretched to feel&mdash;as I have been made to feel&mdash;that I was in
the midst of intrigues and designs, the nature of which I hardly
understood. I must go away out of the atmosphere. I will return
to London when I have forgotten this time. I cannot tell you all
that has been going on, except that I have discovered one deception
after another&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She is an abominable woman,' said Philippa.</p>

<p>'On the island of Samson, at least, there will be no wives who
call themselves widows, and no men who call themselves'&mdash;painters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and poets, she was going to say, but she checked herself&mdash;'call
themselves,' she substituted, 'single men, when they are already
married.'</p>

<p>'But, surely you will not go away now&mdash;just at the very beginning
of the season?'</p>

<p>'The season is nothing at all to me.'</p>

<p>'Oh! But, Armorel&mdash;think. You ought to belong to society.
You are wealthy: you are a most beautiful girl: you are quite
young: and you have so many gifts and accomplishments. My
dear cousin, you might do so well, so very well. There is no position
to which you could not aspire.'</p>

<p>Armorel laughed. 'Not in that way,' she said. 'I have already
told you, dear Philippa, that I am not able to think of things in
that way.'</p>

<p>'Always that dream of girlhood, dear? Well, then, come and
show yourself, if only to make the men go mad with love and the
women with envy. Stay with us. Or, if you prefer it, I will find
you a companion who really does belong to the world.'</p>

<p>'No, no; for the present I have had enough of companions.
I want nothing more than to go home and rest. I feel just a little
battered. My first experience of London has not been, you see,
quite what I expected. Let me go away, and come back when I
feel more charitable towards my fellow-creatures.'</p>

<p>'You have had a most horrid experience,' said Philippa. 'I
trembled for you when I learned who your companion was. I was at
school with her, and&mdash;well, I do not love her. But what could I
do? Mr. Jagenal said she had been most strongly recommended&mdash;I
could not interfere: it was too late: and besides, after what had
happened, years before, it would have looked vindictive. And then
she has been rich and is now poor, and perhaps, I thought, she
wanted money: and when one has quarrelled it is best to say
nothing against your enemy. Besides, I knew nothing definite
against her. She said she was a widow&mdash;my cousin Alec said that
he had been an old friend of her husband: he spoke of having
helped him. Oh! he made up quite a long and touching story
about his dead friend. So, you see, I refrained, and if I could say
nothing good, I would say nothing bad.'</p>

<p>'I am sure that no one can possibly blame you in the matter,
Philippa.'</p>

<p>'Yet I blame myself. For if I had caused a few questions to
be asked at first, all the lies about the widowhood might have been
avoided.'</p>

<p>'Others would have been invented.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps. Well&mdash;she is married, and I don't suppose her stay
here will have done you any real harm. As for her, to go masquerading
as a widow and to tell a thousand lies daily can hardly
do any woman much good. Have you made up your mind how
you will treat her if you should meet?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>'She has settled that question. She wrote me a letter saying
that she has behaved so badly that she wishes never to see me
again. And if we should meet she begs that it will be as perfect
strangers.'</p>

<p>'Really&mdash;after all that has been done&mdash;that is the very
least&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'So we are to meet as strangers. I suppose that will be best.
It would be impossible to ask for explanations. Poor Zoe! One
does not know all her history. She told me once that she had
been very unhappy. I have heard her crying in her room at night.
Perhaps, she is to be more pitied than blamed. It is her husband
whom I find it difficult to forgive and to forget. He is like a
nightmare: he cannot be put so easily out of my mind.'</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, no. I, who have thought of him all my life,
must continue to think of him.'</p>

<p>'You will forgive him, Philippa. You must. Besides, you
have less to forgive. He has never offered his hand and heart to
you.'</p>

<p>Philippa blushed a rosy red, and confusion gathered to her
eyes, because there had, in fact, been many occasions when things
were said which&mdash;&mdash; Armorel was sorry that she had said this.</p>

<p>'You mean, Armorel, that he actually&mdash;did this&mdash;to you?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It was only the other day&mdash;the morning after we read
the play. He came to the National Gallery, where I often go in
the morning, and, in one of the rooms, he told me how much he
loved me&mdash;words, however, go for nothing in such things&mdash;and
kindly said that marriage with me would complete his happiness.'</p>

<p>'Oh! He is a villain&mdash;a villain indeed!' Her voice rose and
her cheeks flushed. 'Forgive him, Armorel? Never!'</p>

<p>'Considering that it was only a day or two before he was going
to announce in the paper the fact that he had been married for
three years, it does seem pretty bad, doesn't it?'</p>

<p>'And you, Armorel?'</p>

<p>'Fortunately, I was able to dismiss him unmistakably.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' Philippa cried in exasperation. 'My cousin has been
guilty of many treacherous and base actions; but this is quite the
worst thing that I have heard of him&mdash;worse even than sending
you his own wife, under a false name and disguised with a lying
story on her lips. No, Armorel; I will never forgive him.
Never!' Her eyes gleamed and her lips trembled. She meant
what she said. 'Never! It is the worst, the most wicked thing
he has ever done&mdash;because he might have succeeded.'</p>

<p>'I suppose he meant to get something by the pretence.'</p>

<p>'He wanted, I suppose, to have it reported that he was going
to marry a rich girl. I had heard that he was continually seen
with you. And I had also heard that he had confessed to an engagement
which was not to be announced. My father has found
out that his affairs are in great confusion.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>'But what good would an engagement of twenty-four hours do
for him?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I do not understand. Perhaps, after all, he had
allowed himself to fall in love&mdash;but I do not know. Men sometimes
seem to behave like mad creatures, with no reason or rule of
self-control&mdash;as if there was no such thing as consequence and no
such thing as the morrow. I do not understand anything about
him. Why are his affairs in confusion? He had, to begin with,
a fortune of more than twelve thousand pounds from his mother;
his pictures latterly commanded a good price. And his paper is
supposed to be doing well. To be sure he keeps horses and goes a
great deal into society. And, perhaps, his wife has been a source
of expense to him. But it is no use trying to explain or to find
out things. Meantime, to you, his conduct has been simply outrageous.
A man who sends his own wife as companion to a girl,
and then makes love to her, is&mdash;my dear, there is no other word&mdash;he
is a Wretch. I will never forgive him.' Armorel felt that she
would keep her word. This pale, calm, self-contained Philippa
could be moved to anger. And again she heard her companion's
soft voice murmuring, 'My dear, the woman shows that she loves
him still.'</p>

<p>'Fortunately for me,' said Armorel, 'my heart has remained
untouched. I was never attracted by him; and latterly, when I
had learned certain things, it became impossible for me to regard
him with common kindliness. And, besides, his pretence and
affectation of love were too transparent to deceive anybody. He
was like the worst actor you ever saw on any stage&mdash;wooden, unreal&mdash;incapable
of impressing anyone with the idea that he meant
what he said.'</p>

<p>'I wonder how far Zoe&mdash;his wife&mdash;knew of this?'</p>

<p>'I would rather not consider the question, Philippa. But,
indeed, one cannot help, just at first, thinking about it, and I am
compelled to believe that she was his servant and his agent throughout.
I believe she was instigated to get money from me if she could,
and I believe she knew his intentions as regards me, and that she
consented. She must have known, and she must have consented.'</p>

<p>'She would excuse herself on the ground of being his wife.
For their husbands some women will do anything. Perhaps she
worships him. His genius, very likely, overshadows and awes her.'
Armorel smiled, but made no objection to this conjecture. 'Some
women worship the genius in a man as if it was the man himself.
Some women worship the man quite apart from his genius. I used
to worship Alec long before he was discovered to be a genius at all.
When I was a school-girl, Alec was my knight&mdash;my Galahad&mdash;purest-hearted
and bravest of all the knights. There was no one
in the world&mdash;no living man, and very few dead men&mdash;Bayard,
Sidney, Charles the First, and two or three more only&mdash;who could
stand beside him. He was so handsome, so brave, so great, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
so good, that other men seemed small beside him. Well, my hero
passed through Cambridge without the least distinction: I thought
it was because he was too proud to show other men how easily he
could beat them. Then he was called to the Bar, but he did not
immediately show his eloquence and his abilities: that was because
he wanted an opportunity. And then I went out into the world,
and made the discovery that my hero was in reality quite an ordinary
young man&mdash;rather big and good-looking, perhaps&mdash;with,
as we all thought then, no very great abilities. And he certainly
was always&mdash;and he is still&mdash;heavy in conversation. But he was
still my cousin, though he ceased to be my hero. He was more
than a cousin&mdash;he was almost my brother; and brothers, as you do
not know, perhaps, Armorel, sometimes do things which require
vast quantities of patience and forgiveness. I am sure no girl's
brother ever wanted forgiveness more than my cousin Alec.'</p>

<p>Her face, cold and pale, had, in fact, the sisterly expression.
Philippa's enemies always declared that in the composition and
making of her the goddess Venus, who presumably takes a large
personal interest in the feminine department, had no lot or part at
all. Yet certain words&mdash;the late companion's words&mdash;kept ringing
in Armorel's ears: 'My dear, the woman loves him still. She has
never ceased to love him.'</p>

<p>'There was nothing to forgive at first,' she went on: 'on the
contrary, everything to admire. Yet his career has been throughout
so unexpected as to puzzle and bewilder us. Consider,
Armorel. Here was a young man who had never in boyhood, or
later, shown the least love or leaning towards Art or the least tinge
of poetical feeling, or the smallest power as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raconteur</i>, or any
charm of writing&mdash;suddenly becoming a fine painter&mdash;a really fine
painter&mdash;a respectable poet, and an admirable story-teller. When
he began with the first picture there grew up in my head a very
imaginative and certain set of ideas connecting the painter's mind
with his Art. I saw a grave mind dwelling gravely and earnestly
on the interpretation of nature. It seemed impossible that one
who should so paint sea and shore should be otherwise than grave
and serious.'</p>

<p>'Impossible,' said Armorel.</p>

<p>'What we had called, in our stupidity, dulness, now became
only seriousness. He took his Art seriously. But then he began to
write verses, and then I found that there was a new mind&mdash;not a part
of the old mind, but a new mind altogether. It was a mind with
a light vein of fancy and merriment: it was affectionate, sympathetic,
and happy: and it seemed distinctly a feminine mind. I
cannot tell you how difficult it was to fit that mind to my cousin
Alec&mdash;it was like dressing him up in an ill-fitting woman's riding-habit.
And then he began those stories of his&mdash;and, behold,
another mind altogether!&mdash;this time a worldly mind&mdash;cynical,
sarcastic, distrustful, epigrammatic, and heartless&mdash;not at all a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
pleasant mind. So that you see I had four different minds all going
about in the same set of bones&mdash;the original Alec Feilding, handsome
and commonplace, but a man of honour: the serious student of
Art: the light and gay-hearted poet, sparkling in his verses like a
glass of champagne: and the cynical man of the world, who does
not believe that there are any men of honour or any good women.
Why, how can one man be at the same time four men? It is impossible.
And now we have a fifth development of Alec. He has
become&mdash;at the same time&mdash;a creature who marries a wife secretly&mdash;no
one knows why: and hides her away for three years and then
suddenly produces her&mdash;no one knows why. What does he hide
her away for? Why does she consent to be hidden away? Then,
the very day before he has got to produce his wife for all the world
to see&mdash;I am perfectly certain that she herself forced him to take
that step&mdash;he makes love to a young lady, and formally asks her to
marry him. Reconcile, if you can, all these contradictions.'</p>

<p>'They cannot possibly be reconciled.'</p>

<p>'We have heard of seven devils entering into one man; but
never of angels and devils mixed, my dear. Such a man cannot
be explained, any more than the Lady Melusina herself.'</p>

<p>'Do not let us try. As for me, I am going to forget the
existence of Mr. Alec Feilding if I can. In order to do this the
quicker I mean to go home and stay there. Come and see me on
the island of Samson, Philippa. But you must not bring your
father, or he may be disappointed at the loss of his ancestral hall.
To you I shall not mind showing the little house where your
ancestors lived.'</p>

<p>'I should like very much&mdash;above all things&mdash;to see the place.'</p>

<p>'I will bribe you to come. I have got a great silver punch-bowl&mdash;old
silver, such as you love&mdash;for you. You shall have a
choice of rings, a choice of snuff-boxes. There is a roll of lace put
away in the cupboard that would make you a lovely dress. It will
be like the receiving of presents which we read of in the old books.'</p>

<p>'I will try to come, Armorel, after the season.'</p>

<p>Armorel laughed.</p>

<p>'There is the difference between us, Philippa. You belong to
the world, and I do not. Oh! I will come back again some day
and look at it again. But it will always be a strange land to me.
You will leave London after the season; I am leaving it before the
season. Come, however, when you can. Scilly is never too hot
in summer nor too cold in winter. Instead of a carriage you shall
have a boat, and instead of a coachman you shall have my boy
Peter. We will sail about and visit the Islands: we will carry our
midday dinner with us: and in the evening we will play and sing.
Nobody will call upon you there: there are no dinner-parties, and
you need not bring an evening dress. The only audience to our
music will be my old servants, Justinian and Dorcas his wife, and
Chessun, and Peter the boy.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no preparations to make: there was nothing to
prevent Armorel from going away immediately. She asked Effie
to go with her. She opened the subject in the evening, when she
and her brother and Roland were all sitting together in her
drawing-room by the light of the fire alone, which she loved. They
were thoughtful and rather silent, conscious of recent events.</p>

<p>'While we were in Regent Street this afternoon, Effie,' said
Armorel, 'I was thinking of the many happy faces that we met.
The street seemed filled with happiness. I was wondering if it was
all real. Are they all as happy as they seem? Is there no falsehood
in their lives? The streets are filled with happy people. The
theatres are filled with happy faces: society shows none but happy
faces. It ought to be the happiest of worlds. Have we, alone,
fallen among pretenders and intriguers?'</p>

<p>'They are gone from you, Armorel. Can you not forget them?'
Effie murmured.</p>

<p>'I seem to hear the murmuring voice of my companion always.
She whispers in her caressing voice, "Oh! my dear, he is so good
and great! He is so full of truth and honour. Will you lend him
a thousand pounds? He thinks so highly of you. A thousand
pounds&mdash;two thousand pounds. If I had it to lay at the feet of so
much genius!" And all the time she is his wife. And in my
thoughts I am always hearing his voice, which I learned to hate,
laying down a commonplace. And in my dreams I awake with a
start, because he is making love to me while Zoe listens at the door.'</p>

<p>'You must go away somewhere,' said Roland.</p>

<p>'I shall go home&mdash;to my own place. Effie, will you come with
me?'</p>

<p>'Go with you? Oh! To Scilly?'</p>

<p>'To the land of Lyonesse. I have arranged it all, dear. Archie
shall have these rooms of mine to live in: you shall come with me.
It is two years since you have been out of London: your cheeks
are pale: you want our sea-breezes and our upland downs. Will
you come with me, Effie?'</p>

<p>She held out her hand. 'I will go with you,' said the girl,
'round the whole world, if you order me.'</p>

<p>'Then that is settled. Archie, you must stay because your
future demands it. I met Mr. Stephenson yesterday. He told
me that he is in great hopes about the play, and that, meantime,
he will be able to put some work into your hands.'</p>

<p>'You are always thinking about me,' said Archie.</p>

<p>'Come to us in the summer. Take your holiday on Samson.
Oh! Effie, we will be perfectly happy. We will forget London,
and everything that has happened. Thank Heaven, the rubies
are gone! I will send a piano there: we will carry with us loads of
books and music. We will have a perfectly lovely time, with no
one but ourselves. Roland will tell you how we will live. You will
do nothing for a time, while you are drinking in the fresh air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
getting strong. Then&mdash;then&mdash;you shall have ideas&mdash;great and
glorious ideas&mdash;and you shall write far, far better poetry than any
you have attempted yet.'</p>

<p>'And, meantime&mdash;we who have to remain behind?' asked
Roland. 'What shall we do when you are gone?'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It takes longer to get to Penzance than to Edinburgh, because
the train ceases to run and begins to crawl as soon as it leaves
Plymouth. The best way is to take the nine o'clock train and to
travel all night. Then you will probably sleep from Reading to
Bristol: from Bristol to Exeter: and from Exeter to Plymouth.
After that you will keep awake.</p>

<p>In this way and by this train Armorel and Effie travelled to
Penzance. Effie fell asleep very soon, and remained asleep all
night long, waking up somewhere between Lostwithiel and Marazion.
Armorel sat up wakeful the whole night through, yet was
not tired in the morning. Partly, she was thinking of her stay in
London, the crowning of her apprenticeship five years long.
Nothing had happened as she had expected. Nothing, in this life,
ever does. She had found the hero of her dreams defeated and
fallen, a pitiable object. But he stood erect again, better armed
and in better heart, his face turned upwards.</p>

<p>Partly, another thing filled her heart and made her wakeful.</p>

<p>Roland and Archie came with them to the station.</p>

<p>'Shall I ever be permitted to visit again the Land of Lyonesse?'
whispered the former at the window just before the guard's
whistle gave the signal for the train to start.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. 'Good-bye, Roland. You will come
to Scilly&mdash;when you please&mdash;as soon as you can.'</p>

<p>He held her hand.</p>

<p>'I live only in that hope,' he replied.</p>

<p>The train began to move. He bent and kissed her fingers.</p>

<p>She leaned forward. 'Roland,' she said, 'I also live only in
that hope.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI_2" id="CHAPTER_XXVI_2"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>NOT THE HEIR, AFTER ALL</small></h2>


<p>The storm expended itself. The gale cannot go on blowing: the
injured man cannot go on raging, cursing, or weeping. Alec Feilding
became calm. Yet a settled gloom rested like a dark cloud
upon his front: he had lost something&mdash;a good part&mdash;of his pristine
confidence. That enviable quality which so much impresses
itself upon others&mdash;called swagger&mdash;had been knocked out of him.
Indeed, he had sustained a blow from which he would never wholly
recover: such a man could never get over the loss of such a fortune:
his great-grandfather, so far as could be learned, lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
fortune and began again, with cheerful heart. Alec would begin
again, because he must, but with rage and bitterness. It was like
being struck down by an incurable disease: it might be alleviated,
but it would never be driven out: from time to time, in spite of
the physicians, the patient writhes and groans in the agony of this
disease. So from time to time will this man, until the end of time,
groan and lament over the wicked waste and loss of that superb
inheritance.</p>

<p>Of course he disguised from himself&mdash;this is one of the things
men always do hide away&mdash;the fact that he himself was part and
parcel of the deed: he had destroyed himself by his own craft and
cunning. Had he not placed his wife with Armorel under instructions
to persuade and coax her into advancing money for his
own purposes, the thing could never have happened.</p>

<p>Henceforth, though the pair should have the desire of their
hearts: though they should march on to wealth and success:
though the wife should invent and contrive with the cleverness of
ten for the good of the firm: though the husband should grow more
and more in the estimation of the outer world into the position of
a Master and an Authority: between the two will lie the memory
of fraud and crime, to divide them and keep them apart.</p>

<p>On the day after the revelation, a thought came into the mind
of the inheritor of the rubies. The thing that had happened
unto him&mdash;could he cause it to happen unto another? Perhaps
one remembers how, on learning that the rubies were to be given
to the eldest grandson of the second daughter, he had dropped,
limp and pale, into a chair. One may also remember how, on
learning that no further investigation would be made, he recovered
again. The fact was, you see, that Mr. Jagenal had made a
little mistake. His searchers had altered the order of the three
sisters. Frances, Alec Feilding's grandmother, was not the
second, but the third daughter. When the rubies were actually
waiting and ready for him, it would have been foolish to mention
that fact, especially as no further search was to be made, and the
elder branch, wherever it was, would never know anything of
the matter at all. Therefore, he then held his tongue.</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, the jewels being worthless, he thought,
first of all, that it would look extremely scrupulous to inform Mr.
Jagenal of the discovery that his grandmother was really the third
daughter: next, if the other branch should be discovered, the
fortunate heir would, like himself, be raised to the heavens only to
be dashed down again to earth. Let someone else, as well as himself,
experience the agonies of that fall. He chuckled grimly as
he considered the torments in store for this fortunate unknown
cousin. As for danger to his wife, he considered rightly that
there was none: the stones had been consigned to the bank by
Armorel, and in her own name: she signed an order for their
delivery to Mr. Jagenal: he had kept them in his safe. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
would certainly lie there some time before he found the new heir.
Nay. They had been in his custody for five years before he gave
them over formally to Armorel. Who could say when the robbery
had been effected? Who would think of asking the bank whether
during the short time the parcel was held in the name of Armorel
it had been taken out? Clearly the whole blame and responsibility
lay with Mr. Jagenal himself. He would have a very curious
problem to solve&mdash;namely, how the rubies had been changed in his
own safe.</p>

<p>'Well, Alec, come to take away your rubies?' asked Mr.
Jagenal, cheerily. 'There they are in that safe.'</p>

<p>'No,' he replied, sadly. 'I am grieved indeed to say that I
have not come for the rubies. I shall never come for the rubies.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Because they are not for me. According to your instructions,
I have no claim to them.'</p>

<p>'No claim?'</p>

<p>'I understand that Miss Rosevean intends to give these jewels
to the first representative of the family of Robert Fletcher. That
is to say, to the eldest grandchild of the first, second, or third
daughter, as the case may be?'</p>

<p>'That is so.'</p>

<p>'Very well. The eldest daughter left no children. You therefore
sent for me as the eldest&mdash;and only&mdash;grandchild of the second
daughter?'</p>

<p>'I did.'</p>

<p>'Then I have to tell you that you are wrong. My grandmother
was the third daughter.'</p>

<p>'Is it possible?'</p>

<p>'Quite possible. She was the third daughter. I was not very
accurately acquainted with that part of my genealogy, and the
other day I could not have told you whether I came from the second
or the third daughter. I have since ascertained the facts. It was
the second daughter who went away to Australia or New Zealand,
or somewhere. I do not know anything at all about my cousins,
but I think it very unlikely that there are none in existence.'</p>

<p>'Very unlikely. What proof have you that your grandmother
was the second daughter?'</p>

<p>'I have an old family Bible&mdash;I can show it you, if you like. In
this has been entered the date of the birth, the place and date of
baptism, the names of the sponsors of all three sisters. There is
also a note on the second sister's marriage and on her emigration.
I assure you there can be no doubt on the subject at all.'</p>

<p>'Oh! This is very disastrous, my dear boy. How could my
people have made such a mistake? Alec, I feel for you&mdash;I do,
indeed!'</p>

<p>'It is most disastrous!' Alec echoed with a groan. 'I have
been in the unfortunate position of a man who is suddenly put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
possession of a great fortune one day, and as suddenly deprived
of it the next. Of course, as soon as I discovered the real facts,
it became my duty to acquaint you with them.'</p>

<p>'By George!' cried Mr. Jagenal. 'If you had kept the facts
to yourself, no one would ever have been any wiser. No one,
because the transfer of the property is a sheer gift made by my
client to you without any compulsion at all. It is a private transaction
of which I should never have spoken to anyone. Well,
Alec, I must not say that you are wrong. But many men&mdash;most
men perhaps&mdash;with a less keen sense of honour than you&mdash;well&mdash;I
say no more. Yet the loss and disappointment must be a bitter
pill for you.'</p>

<p>'It is a bitter pill,' he replied truthfully. 'More bitter than
you would suspect.'</p>

<p>'You will have the satisfaction of feeling that you have behaved
in this matter as a man of the strictest honour.'</p>

<p>'I am very glad, considering all things, that I have not had the
rubies in my own possession, even for a single hour.'</p>

<p>'That is nothing: of course they would have been safe in your
hands. Well, Alec, I am sorry for you. But you are young: you
are clever: you are succeeding hand over hand: pay a little more
attention to your daily expenses, put down your horses and live
for a few years quietly, and you will make your own fortune&mdash;ay,
a fortune greater far than was contained in this unlucky case of
precious stones.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you will renew your search, now, after the descendants
of the second daughter?'</p>

<p>'I suppose we must. Do not forget that if there are no descendants&mdash;or,
which is much the same thing, if we cannot find them
in a reasonable time, I shall advise my client to transfer the jewels
to the grandson of the third daughter. And I hope, my dear boy&mdash;I
hope, I say, that we may never find those descendants.'</p>

<p>Alec departed, a little cheered by the consolation that he had
passed on the disappointment to another.</p>

<p>He went home, and found his wife in the studio, apparently
waiting for him. There were dark rings round her eyes. She
had been weeping. Since the storm they had not spoken to each
other.</p>

<p>He sat down at his table&mdash;it was perfectly bare of papers&mdash;no
sign of any work at all upon it&mdash;and waited for her to begin.</p>

<p>'Is it not time,' she asked, 'that this should cease? You have
reproached me enough, I think. Remember, we are on the same
level. But, whatever I have done, it was done for your sake.
Whatever you have done, was done for your own sake. Now, is
there going to be an end to this situation?'</p>

<p>He made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>'Understand clearly&mdash;if I am to help you for the future: if I
am going to pull you through this crisis: if I am to direct and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
invent and combine for you, I mean to be treated with the semblance
of kindness&mdash;the show of politeness at least.'</p>

<p>He sat up, moved by this appeal, which, indeed, was to his
purse&mdash;that is, to his heart.</p>

<p>'I say, my husband,' she repeated, 'you must understand me
clearly. Again, what I have done was done for you&mdash;for you.
Unless you agree to my conditions it shall have been done&mdash;for
myself. I have four thousand pounds in the bank in my own
name. You cannot touch it. I shall go away and live upon that
money&mdash;apart from you. And you shall have nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Unless what?' He shook off his wrath with a mighty effort,
as a sulky boy shakes off his sulks when he perceives that he
must, and that instantly. He threw off his wrath and sat up with
a wan semblance of a smile, a spectral smile, feebly painted on his
lips. 'Unless what, Zoe? My dear child, can you not make
allowance for a man tried in this terrible fashion? I don't believe
that any man was ever so mocked by Fortune. I have been
crushed. Yes, any terms, any condition you please. Let us forget
the past. Come, dear, let us forget what has happened.' He
sprang to his feet and held out his arms.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment. 'There is no other place for me
now,' she murmured. 'We are on the same level. I am all yours&mdash;now.'</p>

<p>Then she drew herself away, and turned again to the table.
'Come, Alec,'she said, 'to business. Time presses. Sit down,
and give me all your attention.'</p>

<small>THE DESERT ISLAND</small></h2>


<p>The train proceeded slowly along the head of Mount's Bay, the
waters of the high tide washing up almost to the sleepers on the
line. Armorel let down the window and looked out across the
bay&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where the great vision of the guarded Mount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks towards Namancos and Bayona's hold.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'See, Effie!' she cried. 'There is Mount's Bay. There is the
Lizard. There is Penzance. And there&mdash;oh! there is the Mount
itself!'</p>

<p>St. Michael's Mount, always weird and mysterious, rose out of
the waters wrapped in a thin white cloud, which the early sun had
not yet been able to dissipate. I am told there is a very fine modern
house upon the Mount. I prefer not to believe that story. The
place should always remain lonely, awful, full of mystery and
wonder. There is also said to be a battery with guns upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Perhaps. But there are much more wonderful things than these
to tell of the rock. Upon its highest point those gallant miners&mdash;Captain
Caractac and Captain Caerleon, both of Boadicea Wheal&mdash;were
wont to stand gazing out upon the stretch of waters expecting
the white sails and flashing oars of the Ph&oelig;nician fleet, come to
buy their white and precious tin, with strong wines from Syria and
spices from the far East, and purple robes and bronze swords and
spearheads, far better than those made by Flint Jack of the Ordnance
Department. Hither came white-robed priests with flowing
beards and solemn faces&mdash;faces supernaturally solemn, till they
were alone upon the rock. Then, perhaps, an eyelid trembled.
What they did I know not, nor did the people, but it was something
truly awful, with majestic rites and ineffable mysteries and mumbo-jumbo
of the very noblest. Here St. Michael himself once, in the
ages of Faith, condescended to appear. It was to a hermit. Such
appearances were the prizes of the profession. Many went a-hermiting
in hopes of getting a personal call from a Saint who
would otherwise have fought and lived and died quite like the rest
of the world. And, indeed, there were so many Cornish Saints&mdash;such
as St. Buryan, St. Levan, St. Ives, St. Just, St. Keverne,
St. Anthony, not to speak of St. Erth, St. Gulval, St. Austell,
St. Wenn&mdash;all kindly disposed saints, anxious to encourage hermits,
and pleased to extend their own sphere of usefulness, that
few of these holy men were disappointed.</p>

<p>In the bay the blue water danced lightly in the morning breeze:
the low, level sunlight shone upon Penzance on the western side:
the fishing-boats, back from the night's cruise, lay at their moorings,
their brown sails lowered: the merchantmen and trading
craft were crowded in the port: beyond, the white curves chased
each other across the water, and showed that, outside, the breeze
was fresh and the water lively.</p>

<p>'We are almost at home,' said Armorel. 'There is our steamer
lying off the quay&mdash;she looks very little, doesn't she? Only a
short voyage of forty miles&mdash;oh! Effie, I do hope you are a good
sailor&mdash;and we shall be at Hugh Town.'</p>

<p>'Are we really arrived? I believe I have slept the whole
night through,' said Effie, sitting up and pulling herself straight.
'Oh! how lovely!'&mdash;as she too looked out of window. 'Have
you slept well, Armorel?'</p>

<p>'I don't think I have been asleep much. But I am quite
happy, Effie, dear&mdash;quite as happy as if I had been sound asleep
all night. There are dreams, you know, which come to people in
the night when they are awake as well as when they are asleep.
I have been dreaming all night long&mdash;one dream which lasted all
the night&mdash;one voice in my ears&mdash;one hand in mine. Oh! Effie,
I have been quite happy!' She showed her happiness by kissing
her companion. 'I am happier than I ever thought to be. Some
day, perhaps, I shall be able to tell you why.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>And then the train rolled in to Penzance Station.</p>

<p>It was only half-past seven in the morning. The steamer would
not start till half-past ten. The girls sent their luggage on board,
and then went to one of the hotels which stand all in a row facing
the Esplanade. Here they repaired the ravages of the night,
which makes even a beautiful girl like Armorel show like Beauty
neglected, and then they took breakfast, and, in due time, went
on board.</p>

<p>Now behold! They had left in London a pitiless nor'-easter
and a black sky. They found at Penzance a clear blue overhead,
light and sunshine, and a glorious north-westerly breeze. That is
not, certainly, the quarter whose winds allay the angry waves and
soothe the heaving surge. Not at all. It is when the wind is from
the north-west that the waves rise highest and heaviest. Then the
boat bound to Scilly tosses and rolls like a round cork, yet persistently
forces her way westward, diving, ploughing, climbing, slipping,
sliding, and rolling, shipping great seas and shaking them off
again, always getting ahead somehow. Then those who come forth
at the start with elastic step and lofty looks lie low and wish that
some friend would prod Father Time with a bradawl and make him
run: and those who enjoy the sea, Sir, and are never sick, are fain
to put down the pipe with which they proudly started and sink into
nothingness. For taking the conceit out of a young man there is
nothing better than the voyage from Penzance to Scilly, especially
if it be a tripper's voyage&mdash;that is, back again the same day.</p>

<p>There is, on the Scilly boat, a cabin, or rather a roofed and
walled apartment, within which is the companion to the saloon.
Nobody ever goes into the saloon, though it is magnificent with red
velvet, but round this roofed space there is a divan or sofa. And
here lie the weak and fearful, and all those who give in and oppose
no further resistance to the soft influences of ocean. Effie lay
here, white of cheek and motionless. She had never been on the
sea before, and she had a rough and tumbling day to begin with,
and the sea in glory and grandeur&mdash;but all was lost and thrown
away so far as she was concerned. Armorel stood outside, holding
to the ropes with both hands. She was dressed in a waterproof:
the spray flew over her: her cheek was wet with it: her eyes were
bright with it: the heavy seas dashed over her: she laughed and
shook her waterproof: as for wet boots, what Scillonian regardeth
them? And the wind&mdash;how it blew through and through her!
How friendly was its rough welcome! How splendid to be once
more on rough water, the boat fighting against a head wind and
rolling waves! How glorious to look out once more upon the wild
ungoverned waves!</p>

<p>It was not until the boat had rounded the Point and was well
out in the open that these things became really enjoyable. Away
south stood the Wolf with its tall lighthouse: you could see the
white waves boiling and fighting around it and climbing half-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
up. Beyond the Wolf a great ocean steamer plunged through the
water outward bound. Presently there came flying past them the
most beautiful thing ever invented by the wit of man or made by
his craft, a three-masted schooner under full sail&mdash;all sails spread&mdash;not
forging slowly along under poverty-stricken stays which proclaim
an insufficient crew, but flying over the water under all her
canvas. She was a French boat, of Havre.</p>

<p>'There is Scilly, Miss,' said the steward, pointing out to sea.</p>

<p>Yes; low down the land lay, west by north. It looked like a
cloud at first. Every moment it grew clearer; but always low
down. What one sees at first are the eastern shores of St. Agnes
and Gugh, St. Mary's, and the Eastern Islands. They are all
massed together, so that the eye cannot distinguish one from the
other, but all seem to form continuous land. By degrees they
separated. Then one could discover the South Channel and the
North Channel. When the tide is high and the weather fair the
boat takes the former: at low tide, the latter. To-day the captain
chose the South Channel. And now they were so near the land
that Armorel could make out Porthellick Bay, and her heart beat,
though she was going home to no kith or kin, and to nothing but
her <i>familia</i>, her serving folk. Next she made out Giant's Castle,
then the Old Town, then Peninnis Head, black and threatening.
And now they were so near that every carn and every boulder upon
it could be made out clearly: and one could see the water rising
and falling at the foot of the rock, and hear it roaring as it was
driven into the dark caves and the narrow places where the rocks
opened out and made make-believe of a port or haven of refuge.
And now Porthcressa Bay, and now the Garrison, and smooth water.</p>

<p>Then Armorel brought out Effie, pale and languid. 'Now, dear,
the voyage is over: we are in smooth water, and shall be in port in
ten minutes. Look round&mdash;it is all over: we are in the Road. And
over there&mdash;see!&mdash;with his twin hills&mdash;is my dear old Samson.'</p>

<p>There was a little crowd on the quay waiting to see the boat
arrive. All of them&mdash;boatmen, fishermen, and flower-farmers' men,
to say nothing of those representing the interests of commerce&mdash;pressed
forward to welcome Armorel. Everybody remembered her,
but now she was a grand young lady who had left them a simple
child. They shook hands with her and stepped aside. And then
Peter came forward, looking no older but certainly no younger, and
Armorel shook hands with him too. He had the boat alongside,
and in five minutes more the luggage was on board, the mast was
up, the sail set, and Armorel was sitting in her old place, the strings
in her hand, while Peter held the rope and looked out ahead,
shading his eyes with his right hand in the old familiar style.</p>

<p>'It is as if I never left home at all,' said Armorel. 'I sailed
like this with Peter yesterday&mdash;and the day before.'</p>

<p>'You've growed,' said Peter, after an inquiring gaze, being
for the moment satisfied that there was nothing ahead and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
there was no immediate danger of shipwreck on the Nut Rock or
Green Island.</p>

<p>'I am five years older,' Armorel replied.</p>

<p>'It's been a rare harvest this year,' he went on. 'I thought
we should never come to the end of the daffodils.'</p>

<p>'Now I am at home indeed,' said Armorel, 'when I hear the
old, old talk about the flowers. To-morrow, Effie, I will show you
our little fields where we grow all the lovely flowers&mdash;the anemone
and jonquil&mdash;the narcissus and the daffodil. This afternoon, when
we have had dinner and rested a little, I will take you all round
Samson and show you the glories of the place: they are principally
views of other islands: but there is a headland and two bays, and
there are the Tombs of the Kings&mdash;the Ancient Kings of Lyonesse&mdash;in
one of them Roland Lee'&mdash;she blushed and turned away her
head&mdash;henceforth, she understood, this was a name to be treated
with more reverence&mdash;'found a golden torque, which you have
seen me wear. And oh! my dear&mdash;you shall be so happy: the
sea-breeze shall fill your soul with music: the sea-birds shall sing to
you: the very waves shall lap on the shore in rhyme and rhythm for
you: and the sun of Scilly, which is so warm and glowing, but
never too warm, shall colour that pale cheek of yours, and fill out
that spare form. And oh, Effie! I hope you will not get tired of
Samson and of me! We are two maidens living on a desert island:
there is nobody to talk to except each other: we shall wander about
together as we list. Oh, I am so happy, Effie!&mdash;and oh, my dear,
I am so hungry!'</p>

<p>The boat ran up over the white sand of the beach. They
jumped out, and Armorel, leaving Peter to bring along the trunks
by the assistance of the donkey, led the way over the southern hill
to Holy Farm.</p>

<p>'Effie,' she said, 'I have been tormented this morning with the
fear that everything would look small. I was afraid that my old
memories&mdash;a child's memories&mdash;would seem distorted and exaggerated.
Now I am not in the least afraid. Samson has got all
his acres still: he looks quite as big and quite as homely as ever he
did&mdash;the boulders are as huge, the rocks are as steep. I remember
every boulder, Effie, and every bush, and every patch of brown
fern, and almost every trailing branch of bramble. How glorious
it is here! How the sea-breeze sweeps across the hill&mdash;it comes all
the way from America&mdash;across the Atlantic! Effie, I declare you
are looking rosier already. I must sing&mdash;I must, indeed&mdash;I always
used to sing!&mdash;--' She threw up her arms in the old gesture, and
sang a loud and clear and joyous burst of song&mdash;sang like the lark
springing from the ground, because it cannot choose but sing. 'I
used to jump, too; but I do not want, somehow, to jump any
more. Ah, Effie, I was quite certain there would be some falling-off,
but I could not tell in what direction. I can no longer
jump. That comes of getting old. To be sure, I did not jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
when I took Roland Lee about the islands. Sometimes I sang,
but I was ashamed to jump. Here we are upon the top. It is
not a mighty Alp, is it?&mdash;but it serves. Look round&mdash;but only
for a moment, because Chessun will have dinner waiting for us,
and you are exhausted by your bad passage&mdash;you poor thing.
This is our way, down the narrow lanes. Here our fields begin:
they are each about as big as a dinner-table. See the tall hedges
to keep off the north wind: there is a field of narcissus, but there
are no more flowers, and the leaves are dying away. This way!
Ah! Here we are!'</p>

<p>The house did not look in the least mean, or any smaller than
Armorel expected. She became even prouder of it. Where else
could one find a row of palms, with great verbena-trees and prickly
pear and aloes, not to speak of the creepers over the porch, the
gilt figure-head, and the big ship's lantern hung in the porch?
Within, the sunlight poured into the low rooms&mdash;all of them looking
south&mdash;and made them bright: in the room where formerly the
ancient lady passed her time in the hooded chair&mdash;the lady passed
away and the chair gone&mdash;the cloth was spread for dinner. And in
the porch were gathered the serving-folk&mdash;Justinian not a day
older, Dorcas unchanged, and Chessun thin and worn, almost as
old, to look at, as her mother. And as soon as the greetings were
over, and the questions asked and answered, and the news told of
the harvest and the prices, and the girls had run all over the house,
Chessun brought in the dinner.</p>

<p>It is a blessed thing that we must eat, because upon this
necessity we have woven so many pretty customs. We eat a welcome
home: we eat a godspeed: we eat together because we love
each other: we eat to celebrate anything and everything. Above
all, upon such an event as the return of one who has long been
parted from us we make a little banquet. Thought and pains had
been bestowed upon the dinner which Chessun placed upon the
table. Dorcas stood by the table, watching the effect of her cares.
First there was a chicken roasted, with bread crumbs&mdash;a bird
blessed with a delicacy of flavour and a tenderness of flesh and a
willingness to separate at the joints unknown beyond the shores of
Scilly: Dorcas said so, and the girls believed it&mdash;Effie, at least,
willing to believe that nothing in the world was so good as in this
happy realm of Queen Armorel. Dorcas also invited special attention
to the home-cured ham, which was, she justly remarked, mild
as a peach: the potatoes, served in their skins, were miracles of
mealiness&mdash;had Armorel met with such potatoes out of Samson?
had the young lady, her visitor, ever seen or dreamed of such
potatoes? There was spinach grown on the farm, freshly cut, redolent
of the earth, fragrant with the sea-breeze. And there was
home-made bread, sweet, wholesome, and firm. There was also
placed upon the table a Brown George, filled with home-brewed,
furnished with a head snow-white, venerable, and benevolent, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
a head as not all the breweries of Burton&mdash;or even of the whole
House of Lords combined&mdash;could furnish. Alas! that head smiled
in vain upon this degenerate pair. They would not drink the nut-brown,
sparkling beer. It was not wasted, however. Peter had
it when he brought the pack-ass to the porch laden with the last
trunk. Nor did they so much as remove the stopper from the
decanter containing a bottle of the famous blackberry wine, the
primest <i>crû</i> of Samson, opened expressly for this dinner. Yet this
was not wasted either, for Justinian, who knew a glass of good
wine, took it with three successive suppers. Is it beneath the
dignity of history to mention pudding? Consider: pudding is
festive: pudding contributes largely to the happiness of youth.
Armorel and Effie tackled the pudding as only the young and
hungry can. And this day, perhaps from the promptings of simple
piety, being rejoiced that Armorel was back again; perhaps from
some undeveloped touch of poetry in her nature, Chessun placed
upon the table that delicacy seldom seen at the tables of the unfortunate
Great&mdash;who really get so few of the good things&mdash;known as
Grateful Pudding. You know the ingredients of this delightful
dish? More. To mark the day, Chessun actually made it with
cream instead of milk!</p>

<p>'To-morrow,' said Armorel, fired with emulation, 'I will show
you, Effie, what I can do in the way of puddings and cakes. I
always used to make them: and, unless my lightness of hand has
left me, I think you will admire my teacakes, if not my puddings.
Roland Lee praised them both. But, to be sure, he was so easily
pleased. He liked everything on the island. He even liked&mdash;oh!
Effie!&mdash;he liked me.'</p>

<p>'That was truly wonderful, Armorel.'</p>

<p>'Now, Effie, dear, lie down in this chair beside the window.
You can look straight out to sea&mdash;that is Bishop's Rock, with its
lighthouse. Lie down and rest, and I will talk to you about Scilly
and Samson and my own people. Or I will play to you if you like.
I am glad the new piano has arrived safely.'</p>

<p>'I like to look round this beautiful old room. How strange it
is! I have never seen such a room&mdash;with things so odd.'</p>

<p>'They are all things from foreign lands, and things cast up by
the sea. If you like odd things I will show you, presently, my
punch-bowls and the snuff-boxes and watches and things. I did
not give all of them to the care of Mr. Jagenal five years ago.'</p>

<p>'It is wonderful: it is lovely: as if one could ever tire of such
a place!'</p>

<p>'Lie down, dear, and rest. You have had such a tossing about
that you must rest after it, or you may be ill. It promises to be a
fine and clear evening. If it is we will go out by-and-by and see
the sun set behind the Western Rocks.'</p>

<p>'We are on a desert island,' Effie murmured obediently, lying
down and closing her eyes. 'Nobody here but ourselves: we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
do exactly what we please: think of it, Armorel! Nobody wants
any money, here: nobody jostles his neighbour: nobody tramples
upon his friend. It is like a dream of the primitive life.'</p>

<p>'With improvements, dear Effie. My ancestors used to lead
the primitive life when Samson was a holy island and the cemetery
of the Kings of Lyonesse: they went about barefooted and they
were dressed in skins: they fought the wolves and bears, and if
they did not kill the creatures, why, the creatures killed them:
they were always fighting the nearest tribe. And they sucked the
marrow-bones, Effie, think of that! Oh! we have made a wonderful
advance in the civilisation of Samson Island.'</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII_2" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII_2"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>AT HOME</small></h2>


<p>'I am so very pleased to see <em>you</em> here, Mr. Stephenson.' Mrs.
Feilding welcomed him with her sweetest and most gracious smile.
'To attract our few really sincere critics&mdash;there are so many incompetent
pretenders&mdash;as well as the leaders in all the Arts is my great
ambition. And now you have come.'</p>

<p>'You are very kind,' said Dick, blushing. I dare say he is a
really great critic at the hours when he is not a most superior clerk in
the Admiralty. At the same time, one is not often told the whole,
the naked, the gratifying truth.</p>

<p>'To have a <i>salon</i>, that is my desire: to fill it with men of light
and leading. Now you have broken the ice, you will come often,
will you not? Every Sunday evening, at least. My husband will
be most pleased to find you here.'</p>

<p>'Again, you are very kind.'</p>

<p>'We saw you yesterday afternoon at that poor boy's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</i>;
did we not? The crush was too great for us to exchange a word
with you. What do you think of the piece?'</p>

<p>'I always liked it. I was present, you know, at the reading
that night.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes; the reading&mdash;Armorel Rosevean's Reading. Yes.
Though that hardly gave one an idea of the play.'</p>

<p>'The piece went very well indeed. I should think it will catch
on; but of course the public are very capricious. One never knows
whether they will take to a thing or not. To my mind there is
every prospect of success. In any case, young Wilmot has shown
that he possesses poetical and dramatic powers of a very high order
indeed. He seems the most promising of the men before us at
present. That is, if he keeps up to the standard of this first effort.'</p>

<p>'Ye&mdash;es? Of course we must discount some of the promise.
You have heard, for instance, that my husband lent his advice and
assistance?'</p>

<p>'He said so, after the reading, did he not?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>'Nobody knows, Mr. Stephenson,' she clasped her hands and
turned those eyes of limpid blue upon the young man, 'how many
successes my husband has helped to make by his timely assistance!
What he did to this particular play I do not know, of course.
During the reading and during yesterday's performance, I seemed
to hear his voice through all the acts. It haunted me. But
Alec said nothing. He sat in silence, smiling, as if he had never
heard the words before. Oh! It is wonderful! And now&mdash;not
a word of recognition! You help people to climb up, and then
they pretend&mdash;they pretend&mdash;to have got up by their own exertions!
Not that Alec expects gratitude or troubles himself much
about these things, but, naturally, I feel hurt. And oh! Mr.
Stephenson, what must be the conscience of the man&mdash;how can he
bear to live&mdash;who goes about the world pretending&mdash;pretending,'
she shook her head sadly, 'pretending to have written other men's
works!'</p>

<p>'Men will do anything, I suppose. This kind of assistance
ought, however, to be recognised. I will make some allusion to it
in my notice of the play. Meantime, if I can read the future at
all, Master Archie Wilmot's fortune is made, and he will.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Roland Lee showed his picture that night. He had just
come out of a madhouse, had he not?'</p>

<p>'Not quite that. He failed, and dropped out. But what he
did with himself or how he lived for three years I do not exactly
know. He has returned, and never alludes to that time.'</p>

<p>'And he exactly imitates my husband, I am told.'</p>

<p>'No, no&mdash;not exactly. The resemblance is close, only an experienced
critic'&mdash;Oh! Dick Stephenson!&mdash;'could discern the real
differences of treatment.' Mrs. Feilding smiled. 'But I knew
him before he disappeared, and I assure you his method was then
the same as it is now. Very much like your husband's style, yet
with a difference.'</p>

<p>'I am glad there is a difference. An artist ought, at least, to
have a style of his own. You know, I suppose, that Armorel has
gone away?'</p>

<p>'I have heard so.'</p>

<p>'It became possible for us at last to acknowledge things. So I
joined my husband. Armorel went home&mdash;to her own home in the
Scilly Islands. She took Effie Wilmot with her. Indeed, the girl's
flatteries have become necessary to her. I fear she was unhappy,
poor child! I sometimes think, Mr. Stephenson, that she saw too
much of Alec. Of course he was a good deal with us, and I could
not tell her the whole truth, and&mdash;and&mdash;girls' heads are easily
turned, you know, when genius seems to be attracted. Poor
Armorel!' she sighed, playing with her fan. 'Time, I dare say,
will help her to forget.'</p>

<p>'It is a pity,' said Dick Stephenson, changing the subject, because
he did not quite believe this version, 'it is a pity that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Feilding, who can give such admirable advice to a young dramatist,
does not write a play himself.'</p>

<p>'Hush!' she looked all round, 'nobody is listening. Alec <em>has</em>
written a play, Mr. Stephenson. It is a three-act drama&mdash;a tragedy&mdash;strong&mdash;oh!
so strong&mdash;so strong!' She clasped her hands again,
letting the fan dangle from her wrist. 'So effective! I don't know
when I have seen a play with more striking situations. It is accepted.
But not a word has yet been said about it.'</p>

<p>'May I say something about it? Will you let me be the first
to announce it, and to give some little account of it?'</p>

<p>'I will ask Alec. If he consents, I will tell you more about the
play. And, my dear Mr. Stephenson, you, one of our old friends,
really ought to do some work for the paper.'</p>

<p>'I have not been asked,' he replied, colouring, for he was still
at that stage when the dramatic critic is flattered by being invited
to write for a paper.</p>

<p>'You shall be. How do you like the paper?'</p>

<p>'It has so completely changed its character, one would think
that the whole staff had been changed. Everybody reads it now,
and everybody takes it, I believe.'</p>

<p>'The circulation has gone up by leaps and bounds. It is really
wonderful. But, Mr. Stephenson, here is one of the reasons.
Give me a little credit&mdash;poor me! I cannot write, but I can look
on, and I have a pair of eyes, and I can see things. Now, I saw
that Alec was killing himself with writing. Every week a story;
also, every week, a poem; every week an original article; and then
those notes. I made him stop. I said to him, "Stamp your own
individuality on every line of the paper; but write it yourself no
longer. Edit it." You see, it is not as if Alec had to prove his
powers: he has proved them already. So he can afford to let others
do the hard work, while he adds the magic touch&mdash;the touch of
genius&mdash;that touch that goes to the heart. And the result you
see.'</p>

<p>'Yes; the brightest&mdash;cleverest&mdash;most varied paper that exists.'</p>

<p>'With a large staff. Formerly Alec and one or two others
formed the whole staff. Well, Mr. Stephenson, I know that Alec
is going to ask you to do some of the dramatic criticism, and if you
consent I shall be very pleased to have been the first to mention it.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It will be understood from this conversation that the new
methods of managing the business of the Firm were essentially
different from the old. The paper had taken a new departure: it
prospered. It was understood that the editor put less of his own
work into it; but the articles, verses, and stories were all unsigned,
and no one could tell exactly which were his papers: therefore, as
all were clever, his reputation remained on the same level. Also,
there was a thick and solid mass of advertisements each week,
which represented public confidence widespread and deep. 'Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
me,' cries the proprietor of a paper, 'the confidence of advertisers.
That is proof enough of popularity.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Mrs. Feilding moved to another part of the room, and began
to talk with another man.</p>

<p>'My husband,' she said, 'has prepared a little surprise for us
this evening. I say for us, because I have not seen what he has
to show&mdash;since it came back from the frame-maker.'</p>

<p>'It is a picture, then?'</p>

<p>'A picture in a new style. He has abandoned for a time his
coast and sea-shore studies. This is in quite a new style. I think&mdash;I
hope&mdash;that it will be liked as well as his old.'</p>

<p>'He is indeed a wonderful man!'</p>

<p>'Is he not?' She laughed&mdash;a low and musical&mdash;a contented
and a happy laugh. 'Is he not? You never know what Alec may
be going to do next.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Feilding's Sundays have already become a great success:
such a success as a woman of the world may desire, and a clever
woman can achieve. There is once more, as she says proudly, a
<i>salon</i> in London. If it does not quite take the lead that she pretends
in Art and Letters, it is always full. Men who go there once,
go again: they find the kind of entertainment that they like: plenty
of people for talk, to begin with. Then, every man is made, by
the hostess, to feel that his own position in the literary and artistic
world is above even his own estimate: that is soothing: in fact,
the note of the <i>salon</i> is appreciation&mdash;not mutual admiration, as the
envious do enviously affirm. Moreover, everybody in the <i>salon</i> has
done something&mdash;perhaps not much, but something. And then the
place is one where the talk is delightfully free, almost as free as in
a club smoking-room. Every evening, again, there is some kind
of entertainment, but not too much, because the <i>salon</i> has to keep
up its reputation for conversation, and music destroys conversation.
'Let us,' said Mrs. Feilding, 'revive the dead art of conversation.
Let the men in this room make their reputation as they did a hundred
years ago, for brilliant talk.' I have not heard that Mrs.
Feilding has yet developed a talker like the mighty men of old:
perhaps one will come along later: those, however, who have looked
into the subject with an ambition in that line, and have ascertained
the nature of the epigrams, repartees, retorts, quips, jokes, and
personal observations attributed to Messrs. Douglas Jerrold and his
brilliant circle are doubtful of reviving that Art except in a modified
and a greatly chastened, even an effeminate form.</p>

<p>The entertainments provided by Mrs. Feilding consisted of a
little music or a little singing&mdash;always by a young and little-known
professional: there was generally something in the fashion&mdash;young
lady with a banjo or a tum-tum, or anything which was popular:
young gentleman to whistle: young actor or actress to give a
character sketch: sometimes a picture sent in for private exhibition:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
sometimes a little poem printed for the evening and handed
about&mdash;one never knew what would be done.</p>

<p>But always the hostess would be gracious, winning, caressing,
smiling, and talking incessantly: always she would be gliding about
the room, making her friends talk: the happy wife of the most
accomplished and most versatile man in London. And always
that illustrious genius himself, calm and grave, taking Art
seriously, laying down with authority the opinion that should be
held to a circle who surrounded him. The circle consisted chiefly
of women and of young men. Older men, with that reluctance to
listen to the voice of Authority which distinguishes many after
thirty, held aloof and talked with each other. 'Alec Feilding,'
said one of them, expressing the general opinion, 'may be a mighty
clever fellow, but he talks like a dull book. You've heard it all
before. And you've heard it better put. It's wonderful that such
a clever dog should be such a dull dog.'</p>

<p>They came, however, in spite of the dulness: the wife would
have carried off a hundred dull dogs.</p>

<p>As in certain earlier and better-known circles, the men greatly
outnumbered the women. 'I am not in love with my own sex,'
said Mrs. Feilding, quite openly. 'I prefer the society of men.'
But some women came of their own accord, and some were brought
by their fathers, husbands, lovers, and brothers. No one could
say that ladies kept away from Mrs. Feilding's Sunday evenings.</p>

<p>This evening, the principal thing was the uncovering of a new
picture&mdash;Mr. Feilding's new picture.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the painter-poet, in obedience to a whisper from
his wife, moved slowly, followed by his ring of disciples&mdash;male
and female&mdash;all young&mdash;a callow brood&mdash;to the upper end of the
room, where was an easel. A picture stood upon it, but a large
green cloth was thrown over it.</p>

<p>'I thought,' said Mr. Alec Feilding, in his most dignified manner,
'that you would like to see this picture before anyone else.
It is one of the little privileges of our Sunday evenings to show
things to each other. Some of you may remember,' he said, with
the true humility of genius, 'that I have exhibited, hitherto, chiefly
pictures of coast scenery. I have always been of opinion that a
man should not confine himself to one class of subjects. His
purchasing public may demand it, but the true artist should disregard
all and any considerations connected with money.'</p>

<p>'Your true artist hasn't always got a weekly journal to fall back
upon,' growled a young A.R.A. who did stick to one class of subjects.
He had been brought there. As a rule, artists are not found at
Mrs. Feilding's, nor do they rally round the cleverest man in
London.</p>

<p>'I say,' repeated the really great man, 'that the wishes of
buyers must not be weighed for an instant in comparison with
the true interests of Art.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>'Like a copy-book,' murmured the Associate.</p>

<p>'Therefore, I have attempted a new line altogether. I have
made new studies. They have cost a great deal of time and trouble
and anxious thought. It is quite a new departure. I anticipate,
beforehand, what you will say at first. But&mdash;Eccolo!'</p>

<p>He lifted the green cloth. At the same moment his wife
turned up a light that stood beside the painting. He disclosed
a really very beautiful painting: a group of trees beside a shallow
pool of water: the trees were leafless: a little snow lay at their
roots: the pool was frozen over: there was a little mist over the
ground, and between the trunks one saw the setting sun.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/i_331.jpg" width="392" height="600" alt="He disclosed a really very beautiful painting." title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>He disclosed a really very beautiful painting.</i></span>
</div>

<p>'By Jove! It's a Belgian picture!' cried the Associate. And,
indeed, you may see hundreds of pictures exactly in this style in
the Brussels galleries, where the artists are never tired of painting
the flat country and the trees, at every season and under every
light.</p>

<p>'Precisely,' said the painter. 'That is the remark which I
anticipated. Let us call it&mdash;if you like&mdash;a Belgian picture. The
subject is English: the treatment, perhaps, Belgian. For my part,
I am not too proud to learn something from the Belgians.'</p>

<p>The Associate touched the man nearest him&mdash;an artist, not yet
an Associate&mdash;by the arm.</p>

<p>'Ghosts!' he murmured. 'Spooks and ghosts!'</p>

<p>'Spectres!' replied the other. 'Phantoms and bogies!'</p>

<p>'A Haunted Studio!' said the Associate. 'My knees totter!
My hair stands on end!'</p>

<p>'I tremble&mdash;I have goose-flesh!' replied his friend.</p>

<p>'Let us&mdash;let us run to the Society of Psychical Research!'
whispered the Associate.</p>

<p>'Let us swiftly run!' said the other.</p>

<p>They fled, swiftly and softly. Only Mrs. Feilding observed
their flight. She also gathered from their looks the subject of
their talk. And she resolved that she would not, henceforth,
encourage artists at her Sunday evenings. She turned to Dick
Stephenson.</p>

<p>'You, Mr. Stephenson,' she said, 'who are a true critic and
understand work, tell me what <em>you</em> think of the picture.'</p>

<p>The great critic&mdash;he was not really a humbug; he was very
fond of looking at pictures; only, you see, he was not an artist&mdash;advanced
to the front, bent forward, considered a few moments,
and then spoke.</p>

<p>'A dexterous piece of work&mdash;truly dexterous in the highest
sense: full of observation intelligently and poetically rendered:
careful: truthful: with intense feeling. I could hardly have
believed that any English painter was capable of work in this
<i>genre</i>.'</p>

<p>The people all gazed upon the canvas with rapt admiration:
they murmured that it was wonderful and beautiful. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Alec covered up the picture, and somebody began to play something.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'Alec,' said Mr. Jagenal, who seldom came to these gatherings,
'I congratulate you. Your picture is very good. And in a new
style. When will you be content to settle down in the jog-trot
that the British public love?'</p>

<p>'Let me change my subject sometimes. When I am tired of
trees I will go back, perhaps, to the coast and seapieces.'</p>

<p>'Ah! But take care. There's a fellow coming along&mdash;&mdash; By
the way, Alec, I have made a discovery lately.'</p>

<p>'What is it?'</p>

<p>'About those rubies. Why, man'&mdash;for Alec turned suddenly
pale&mdash;'you remember that business still?'</p>

<p>'Indeed I do,' he replied. 'And I am not likely to forget it
in a hurry.'</p>

<p>'My dear boy, to paint such pictures is worth many such bags
of precious stones, if you will only think so.'</p>

<p>'What's your discovery?' Alec asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>'Well; I have found, quite accidentally, the eldest grandchild
of the second daughter&mdash;your great-aunt.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' Again he changed colour. 'Then you will, I suppose,
hand him over the things.'</p>

<p>'Yes, certainly. I have sent for him. He does not yet know
what I want him for. And I shall give him the jewels in obedience
to Armorel's instructions. Alec, I have always been desperately
sorry for your unfortunate discovery.'</p>

<p>'It caused a pang, certainly. And who is my cousin?'</p>

<p>'Well, Alec, I will not tell you until I have made quite sure.
Not that there is any doubt. But I had better not. You will
perhaps like to make his acquaintance. Perhaps you know him
already. I don't say, mind.'</p>

<p>'Well, Sir,' said Alec, 'when he realises the extent and value
of this windfall, I expect he will show a depth of gratitude which
will astonish you. I do, indeed.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'Zoe,' he said, when everybody was gone, 'are you quite sure
that in the matter of those rubies your action can never be discovered?'</p>

<p>'Anything may be discovered. But I think&mdash;I believe&mdash;that
it will be difficult. Why?'</p>

<p>'Because my cousin, the grandson of Robert Fletcher's second
daughter, has been found, and he will receive the jewels to-morrow.
And when he finds out what they are worth&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Then, Alec, it will be asked who had the jewels. They were
taken to the bank by Mr. Jagenal and taken thence to Mr.
Jagenal. What have you&mdash;what have I&mdash;to do with them? Don't
think about it, Alec. It has nothing to do with us. No suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
can possibly attach to us. Forget the whole business.
The evening went off very well. The picture struck everybody
very much. And I've laid the foundation for curiosity about the
play. And as for the paper, I was going into the accounts this
morning: it is paying at the rate of three thousand a year. Alec,
you have never until now been really and truly the cleverest man
in London.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX_2" id="CHAPTER_XXIX_2"></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>THE TRESPASS OFFERING</small></h2>


<p>It was a day in midwinter. Over the adjacent island of Great
Britain there was either a yellow fog, or a white fog, or a black fog.
Perhaps there was no fog at all, but a black east wind, or there was
melting snow, or there was cold sleet and rain: whatever there
was, to be out of doors brought no joy, and the early darkness was
tolerable because it closed and hid and put away the day. In the
archipelago of Scilly, the sky was bright and clear: the sea was blue,
except in the shallow places, where it was a light transparent green:
the waves danced and sparkled: round the ledges of the rocks the
white foam rolled and leaped: the sunshine was warm: the air
was fresh. The girls stood on the northern carn of Samson. They
had been on the island now for eight months. For the greater part
of that time they were alone. Only in the summer Archie came
to pay them a visit. His play was accepted: it would probably be
brought out in January, perhaps not till later, according to the
success of the piece then running. Meantime, he had got introductions,
thanks to Armorel's evening, and now found work enough
to keep him going on one or two journals, where his occasional
papers&mdash;the papers of a young and clever man feeling his way to
style&mdash;were taken and published. And he was, of course, writing
another play: he was in love with another heroine&mdash;happy, if he
knew his own happiness, in starting on that rare career in which a
man is always in love, and blamelessly, even with the knowledge
of his wife, with a succession of the loveliest and most delightful
damsels&mdash;country girls and princesses&mdash;lasses of the city and of
the milking path&mdash;Dolly and Molly and stately Kate, and the
Duchess of Dainty Device. As yet, he had only lost his heart to
two and was now raving over the second of his sweethearts. One
such youth I have known and followed as he passed from the
Twenties to the Thirties&mdash;to the Forties&mdash;even to the Fifties. He
has always loved one girl after the other. He knows not how life
can exist unless a man is in love: he is a mere slave and votary of
Love: yet never with a goddess of the earth. He loves an image&mdash;a
simulacrum&mdash;a phantom: and he looks on with joy and satisfaction&mdash;yea!
the tears of happiness rise to his eyes when he sees
that phantom at the last, after many cruel delays, fondly embraced&mdash;not
by himself&mdash;but by another phantom. Happy lover!
so to have lost the substance, yet to be satisfied with the shadow!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Except for Archie's visit they had no guests all through the
summer. The holiday visitors mostly arrive at Hugh Town, sail
across to Tresco Gardens and back, some the same day, some
the next day, thinking they have seen Scilly. None of them land
on Samson. Few there are who sail about the Outer Islands where
Armorel mostly loved to steer her boat. The two girls spent the
whole time alone with each other for company. I do not know
whether the literature of the country will be enriched by Effie's
sojourn in Lyonesse, but one hopes. At least, she lost her pale
cheeks and thin form: she put on roses, and she filled out: she
became almost as strong as Armorel, almost as dexterous with the
sheet, and almost as handy with the oar. But of verses I fear
that few came to her. With the best intentions, with piles of
books, these two maidens idled away the summer, basking on the
headlands, lying among the fern, walking over the downs of
Bryher and St. Martin's, sailing in and out among the channels,
bathing in Porth Bay, or off the lonely beach of Ganilly in the
Eastern group. Always something to see or something to do.
Once they ventured to sail by themselves&mdash;a parlous voyage, but
the day was calm&mdash;all the way round Bishop's Rock and back:
another time they sailed&mdash;but this time they took Peter&mdash;among
the Dogs of Scilly, climbed up on Black Rosevean, and stood on
Gorregan with the cruel teeth. Once, on a very calm day in July,
they even threaded the narrow channel between the twin rocks
known together as the Scilly. Always there was something new
to do or to see. So the morning and the afternoon passed away,
and there was nothing left but tea and a little music, and a stroll
in the moonlight or beneath the stars, and a talk together, and so
to bed: and if there came a rainy day, the cakes to make and
the puddings to compose! A happy, lazy, idle, profitable time!</p>

<p>'We have been six months here and more, Effie,' said Armorel.
They were sitting in the sunshine in the sheltered orchard, among
the wrinkled and twisted old apple-trees. 'What next? When
shall we think of going back to London? We must not stay here
altogether, lest we rust. We will go back&mdash;shall we?&mdash;as soon as
the short, dark days are over, and we will make a new departure
somehow, but in what direction I do not quite know. Shall we
travel? Shall we cultivate society? What shall we do?'</p>

<p>'We will go back to London as soon as Archie's play is produced.
Dear Armorel, I do not want ever to go away. I should
like to stay here with you always and always. It has been a time
of peace and quiet. Never before have I known such peace and
such quiet. But we must go. We must go while the spell of the
place is still upon us. Perhaps if we were to stay too long&mdash;Nature
does not expect us to outstay her welcome&mdash;not that her welcome
is exhausted yet&mdash;but if we go away, shall we ever come back?
And, if so, will it be quite the same?'</p>

<p>'Nothing ever returns,' said Armorel the sage. 'We shall go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
away and we shall come back again, and there will be changes.
Everything changes daily. The very music of the sea changes
from day to day; but it is always music. My old grandmother in
the great chair used to hold her hand to her ear&mdash;so&mdash;to catch
the lapping of the waves and the washing of the tide among the
rocks. It was the music that she had known all her life. But the
tune was different&mdash;the words of the song in her head were different&mdash;the
key was changed&mdash;but always the music. Oh, my dear! I
never tire of this music. We will go away, Effie; we must not
stay too long here, lest we fall in love with solitude and renounce
the world. But we will come back and hear the same music again,
with a new song. We must go back.' She sighed. 'Eight months.
We must go and see Archie's play. Archie! It will be a proud
and glorious day for him, if it succeeds. It must succeed. And
not a word or a sign all this time from Roland! What is he doing?
Why&mdash;&mdash;' She stopped.</p>

<p>Effie laid a hand on hers.</p>

<p>'You have been restless for some days, Armorel,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes. I do not doubt him. No&mdash;no&mdash;he has returned to
himself. He can never&mdash;never again&mdash;I do not doubt him.' She
sprang to her feet. 'Oh, Effie! I do not doubt, but sometimes I
fear. What do I fear? Why, I know there may be failure, but
there can never again be disgrace.'</p>

<p>'You think of him so much, Armorel,' said Effie, with a touch
of jealousy.</p>

<p>'I cannot think of him too much.' She looked out upon the
sunlit sea at their feet, talking as one who talks to herself. 'How
can I think of him too much? I have thought of him every day
for five years&mdash;every day. I love him, Effie. How can you think
too much of the man you love? Suppose I were to hear that he
had failed again. That would make no difference. Suppose he
were to sink low&mdash;low&mdash;deep down among the worst of men&mdash;that
would make no difference. I love the man as he may be&mdash;as
he shall be&mdash;by the help of God, if not in this world, then in the
world to come! I love him, Effie!'</p>

<p>She stopped because her voice choked with a sob. The strength
of her passion&mdash;not for nothing was the Castilian invader wrecked
upon Scilly!&mdash;frightened the other girl. She had never dreamed of
such a passion; yet she knew that Armorel thought continually of
this man. She did not dare to speak. She looked on with clasped
hands, in silence.</p>

<p>Armorel softened again. The tumult of her heart subsided.
She turned to Effie and kissed her.</p>

<p>'Forgive me, dear: you know now&mdash;but you have guessed
already. Let us say no more. But I must see him soon. I must
go to see him if he cannot come to see me. Let us go over the
hill. This little orchard is like a hothouse this morning.'</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the hill they saw the steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
from Penzance rounding Bar Point on St. Mary's and coming
through the North Channel.</p>

<p>'They have had a fine passage,' said Armorel. 'The boat must
have done it in three hours. I wonder if she brings anything for
us. It is too early for the magazines. I wrote for those books,
but I doubt if there has been time. And I wrote to Philippa, but
I do not expect a letter in reply by this post.'</p>

<p>'And I wrote to Archie, but I do not know whether I shall get
a letter to-day. Suppose there should come a visitor?'</p>

<p>'Few visitors come to Scilly in the winter&mdash;and none to Samson.
We are alone on our desert island, Effie. See, the steamer is entering
the port: the tide is low: she cannot get alongside the quay.
It is such a fine day that it is a pity we did not sail over this
morning and meet the steamer. There goes the steam-launch from
Tresco.'</p>

<p>It is quite a mile from Samson to the quay of Hugh Town; but
the air was so clear that Armorel, whose eyes were as good as any
ordinary field-glass, could plainly make out the agitation and
bustle on the quay caused by the arrival of the steamer.</p>

<p>'The boat always carries my thoughts back to London,' said
Armorel. 'And we have been talking about London, have we
not? When I was a child the boat came into the Road out of
the Unknown, and next day went back to the Unknown. What
was the other side like? I filled it up with the vague splendour
of a child's imagination. The Unknown to me was like the sunrise
or the sunset. Well ... now I know. The poets say that
knowledge makes us no happier. I think they are quite wrong.
It is always better to know everything, even though it's little
joy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To feel that Heaven is farther off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than when one was a boy.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'There is a boat,' she went on, after a while. 'She is putting
out from the port. I wonder what boat it is. Perhaps she is
going to Bryher&mdash;or to St. Martin's&mdash;or to St. Agnes. It is not
the lighthouse boat. She is sailing as if for Samson; but she cannot
be coming here. What a lovely breeze! She would be here in
a quarter of an hour. I suppose she must be going to Tresco. See
what comes of living on a desert island. We are actually speculating
about the voyage of a sailing-boat across the Road! Effie, we
are little better than village gossips. You shall marry Mr. Paul
Pry.'</p>

<p>'She looks very pretty,' said Effie, 'heeling over with the wind,
wherever she is going.'</p>

<p>'They are steering south of Green Island,' said Armorel.
'That is very odd. If she had been making for Bryher or Tresco
she would leave Green Island on the lee and steer up the channel
past Puffin. I really believe that she is coming to Samson. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
expect there is a parcel for us. Let us run down to the beach,
Effie. We shall get there just in time.'</p>

<p>They ran down the hill. As the boatman lowered the sail and
the boat grounded on the firm white sand of the beach, the girls
arrived. The boat brought, however, no packet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried Effie. 'It is Roland Lee!'</p>

<p>It was none other than that young man of whom they had been
speaking. Armorel changed colour: she blushed a rosy red: then
she recovered quickly and stepped forward, as Roland leaped out
upon the sand. 'Welcome back to Samson!' she said, giving him
her hand with her old frankness. 'We expected you to come, but
we did not know when.'</p>

<p>'May I stay?' he murmured, taking her hand and looking into
her face.</p>

<p>'You know&mdash;yourself,' she replied.</p>

<p>He made answer by shouldering his portmanteau. 'No new
road has been made, I suppose,' he said. 'Shall I go first? How
well I remember the way over the hill! Samson has changed
little since I was here last.'</p>

<p>He led the way, all laughing and chatting as if his visit was expected,
and as if it were the most natural thing in the world and
the most common thing to run down to the beach and meet a
morning caller from London Town. But Effie, who was as observant
as a poet ought to be, saw how Roland kept looking round as
he led, as if he would be still catching sight of Armorel.</p>

<p>'Come, Dorcas,' cried Armorel, when they arrived at the house.
'Come, Chessun&mdash;here is Mr. Roland Lee. You have not forgotten
Mr. Lee. He has come to stay with us again.' The serving-women
came out and shook hands with him in friendly fashion.
Forgotten Mr. Lee? Why, he was the only young man who had
been seen at Holy Farm since Armorel's brothers were drowned&mdash;victims
to the relentless wrath of those execrable rubies.</p>

<p>'You shall have your old room,' said Dorcas. 'Chessun will
air the bed for you and light a fire to warm the room. Well, Mr.
Lee, you are not much altered. Your beard is grown, and you're
a bit stouter. Not much changed. You're married yet?'</p>

<p>'Not yet, Dorcas.'</p>

<p>'Armorel, she's a woman now. When you left her she was
little better than a child. I say she's improved, but perhaps you
wish she was a child again?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, no,' said Roland.</p>

<p>Everything was quite commonplace. There was not the least
romance about the return of the wanderer. It was half-past two.
He had had nothing to eat since breakfast, and after three hours
and more upon the sea one is naturally hungry. Chessun laid the
cloth and put the cold beef&mdash;cold boiled beef&mdash;upon the table.
Pickles were also produced&mdash;a pickled walnut is not a romantic
object. The young man was madly in love: he had come all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
way from town on purpose to explain and dilate upon that wonderful
accident: yet he took a pickled walnut. Nay, he was in a
famishing condition, and he tackled the beef and beer&mdash;that old
Brown George full of the home-brewed with a head of foam like
the head of a venerable bishop&mdash;as if he was not in love at all.
And Armorel sat opposite to him at the table talking to him about
the voyage and his studio and whether he had furnished it, and all
kinds of things, and Chessun hovered over him suggesting more
pickles. And he laughed, and Armorel laughed&mdash;why not? They
were both as happy as they could be. But Effie wondered how
Armorel, whose heart was so full, whose soul was so charged
and heavy with love, could laugh thus gaily and talk thus idly.</p>

<p>After luncheon, which of course was, in Samson fashion, dinner,
Roland got up and stood in the square window, looking out to sea.
Armorel stood beside him.</p>

<p>'I remember standing here,' he said, 'one morning five years
ago. A great deal has happened since then.'</p>

<p>'A great deal. We are older&mdash;we know more of the world.'</p>

<p>'We are stronger, Armorel'&mdash;their eyes met&mdash;'else I should
not be here.'</p>

<p>It was quite natural that Armorel should put on her jacket and
take her hat, and that they should go out together. Effie took her
seat in the window and lay in the sunshine, a book neglected in
her lap. Armorel had got her lover back. She loved him. Oh!
she loved him. So heavenly is the contemplation of human love
that Effie found it more soothing than the words of wisdom in her
book, more full of comfort than any printed page. Human love,
she knew well, would never fall to her lot: all the more should
she meditate on love in others. Well, she has her compensations:
while others act she looks on: while others feel, she will tell the
world, in her verse, what and how they feel: to be loved is the
chief and crowning blessing for a woman, but such as Effie have
their consolations.</p>

<p>She looked up, and saw old Dorcas standing in the door.</p>

<p>'They have gone out in the boat,' she said. 'When I saw him
coming over the hill I said to Chessun, "He's come again. He's
come for Armorel at last." I always knew he would. And now
they've gone out in the boat to be quite alone. Is he worth her,
Miss Effie? Is he worth my girl?'</p>

<p>'If he is not she will make him worth her. But nobody
could be worth Armorel. Are you sure you are not mistaken,
Dorcas?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;no, I am not mistaken. The love-light is in his
eyes, and the answering love in hers. I know the child. She
loved him six years ago. She is as steadfast as the compass. She
can never change. Once love always love, and no other love. She
has thought about him ever since. Why did she go away and
leave us alone without her for five long years? She wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
learn things so as to make herself fit for him. As if he would care
what things she knew if only he loved her! 'Twas the beautiful
maid he would love, with her soft heart and her tender voice and
her steadfast ways&mdash;not what she knew.'</p>

<p>'Oh! but, Dorcas, perhaps&mdash;you are not quite sure&mdash;we do not
know&mdash;one may be mistaken.'</p>

<p>'<em>You</em> may be mistaken, Miss Effie. As for me, I've been
married for five-and-fifty years. A woman of my age is never mistaken.
I saw the love-light in his eyes, and I saw the answering
love in hers. And I know my own girl that I've nursed and
brought up since the cruel sea swallowed up her father and her
mother and her brothers. No, Miss Effie, I know what I can
see.'</p>

<p>One does not, as a rule, go in a small open boat upon the water
in December, even in Scilly, whose winter hath nor frost nor snow.
But these two young people quite naturally, and without so much
as asking whether it was summer or winter, got into the boat.
Roland took the oars&mdash;Armorel sat in the stern. They put out
from Samson what time the midwinter sun was sinking low. The
tide was rising fast, and the wind was from the south-east. When
they were clear of Green Island, Roland hoisted the sail.</p>

<p>'I have a fancy,' he said, 'to sail out to Round Island and to
see Camber Rock again, this first day of my return. Shall we
have time? We can let the sun go down: there will be light
enough yet for an hour. You can steer the craft in the dark,
Armorel. You are captain of this boat, and I am your crew.
You can steer me safely home, even on the darkest night&mdash;in the
blackest time,' he added, with a deeper meaning than lay in his
simple words.</p>

<p>The sail caught the breeze, and the boat heeled over. Roland
sat holding the rope while Armorel steered. Neither spoke. They
sailed up New Grinsey Channel between Tresco and Bryher, past
Hangman's Island, past Cromwell's Castle. They sailed right
through beyond the rocks and ledges outlying Tresco, outside
Menovawr, the great triple rock, with his two narrow channels,
and so to the north of Round Island. The sky was aflame: the
waters were splendid with the colours of the west. They rounded
the island. Then Roland lowered the sail and put out the oars.
'We must row now,' he said. 'How glorious it all is! I am back
again. Nine short months ago&mdash;you remember, Armorel?&mdash;how
could I have hoped to come here again&mdash;to sail with you in your
boat?'</p>

<p>'Yet you are here,' she said simply.</p>

<p>'I have so much to say, and I could not say it, except in the
boat.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Roland.'</p>

<p>'First of all, I have sold that picture. It is not a great price
that I have taken. But I have sold it. You will be pleased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
hear that. Next, I have two commissions, at a better price. Don't
believe, Armorel, that I am thinking about nothing but money.
The first step towards success, remember, is to be self-supporting.
Well&mdash;I have taken that first step. I have also obtained some
work on an illustrated paper. That keeps me going. I have regained
my lost position&mdash;and more&mdash;more, Armorel. The way is
open to me at last: everything is open to me now if I can force
myself to the front.'</p>

<p>'No man can ask for more, can he?'</p>

<p>'No. He cannot. As for the time, Armorel, the horrible,
shameful time&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Roland, you said you would not come here until the shame of
that time belonged altogether to the past.'</p>

<p>'It does: it does: yet the memory lingers&mdash;sometimes, at
night, I think of it&mdash;and I am abased.'</p>

<p>'We cannot forget&mdash;I suppose we can never forget. That is
the burden which we lay upon ourselves. Oh! we must all walk
humbly, because we have all fallen so far short of the best, and
because we cannot forget.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;to be forgiven. That also is so hard.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Roland, you mistake. We can always forgive those we love&mdash;yes&mdash;everything&mdash;everything&mdash;until
seventy times seven. How
can we love if we cannot forgive? The difficulty is to forgive ourselves.
We shall do that when we have risen high enough to understand
how great a thing is the soul&mdash;I don't know how to put what
I wish to say. Once I read in a book that there was a soul who
wished&mdash;who would not?&mdash;to enter into heaven. The doors were
wide open: the hands of the angels were held out in love and
welcome: but the soul shrank back. "I cannot enter," he said,
"I cannot forgive myself." You must learn to forgive yourself,
Roland. As for those who love you, they ask for nothing more
than to see your foot upon the upward slope.'</p>

<p>'It is there, Armorel. Twice you have saved me: once from
death by drowning: once from a worse death still&mdash;the second
death. Twice your arms have been stretched out to save me from
destruction.'</p>

<p>They were silent again. The boat rocked gently in the water:
the setting sun upon Armorel's face lent her cheek a warmer, softer
glow, and lit her eyes, which were suffused with tears. Roland,
sitting in his place, started up and dipped the oars again.</p>

<p>'It is nearly half-tide now,' he said. 'Let us row through
the Camber Pass. I want to see that dark ravine again. It is the
place I painted with you&mdash;you of the present, not of the past&mdash;in
it. I have sold the picture, but I have a copy. Now I have
two paintings, with you in each. One hangs in the studio, and
the other in my own room, so that by night as well as by day I feel
that my guardian angel is always with me.'</p>

<p>Through the narrow ravine between Camber Rock and Round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Island the water races and boils and roars when the tide runs
strongly. Now, it was flowing gently&mdash;almost still. The sun was
so low that the rock on the east side was obscured by the great
mass of Round Island: the channel was quite dark. The dipping
of the oars echoed along the black walls of rock; but overhead
there was the soft and glowing sky, and in the light blue already
appeared two or three stars.</p>

<p>'A strange thing has happened to me, Armorel,' Roland said,
speaking low, as if in a church&mdash;'a very strange and wonderful
thing. It is a thing which connects me with you and with your
people and with the Island of Samson. You remember the story
told us one evening&mdash;the evening before I left you&mdash;by the Ancient
Lady?'</p>

<p>'Of course. She told that story so often, and I used to suffer
such agonies of shame that my ancestor should act so basely, and
such terrors in thinking of the fate of his soul, that I am not likely
to forget the story.'</p>

<p>'You remember that she mistook me for Robert Fletcher?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I remember.'</p>

<p>'She was not so very far wrong, Armorel; because, you see,
I am Robert Fletcher's great-grandson.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Roland! Is it possible?'</p>

<p>'I suppose that there may have been some resemblance. She
forgot the present, and was carried back in imagination to the past,
eighty years ago.'</p>

<p>'Oh! And you did not know?'</p>

<p>'If you think of it, Armorel, very few middle-class people are
able to tell the maiden name of their grandmother. We do not
keep our genealogies, as we should.'</p>

<p>'Then how did you find it out?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Jagenal, your lawyer, found it out. He sent for me and
proved it quite clearly. Robert Fletcher left three daughters.
The eldest died unmarried: the second and third married. I am
the grandson of the second daughter who went to Australia. Now,
which is very odd, the only grandson of the third daughter is a
man whose name you may remember. They call him Alec Feilding.
He is at once a painter, a poet, a novelist, and is about
to become, I hear, a dramatist. He is my own cousin. This is
strange, is it not?'</p>

<p>'Oh! It is wonderful.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Jagenal, at the same time, made me a communication.
He was instructed, he said, by you. Therefore, you know the
nature of the communication.'</p>

<p>'He gave you the rubies.'</p>

<p>'Yes. He gave them to me. I have brought them back.
They are in my pocket. I restore them to you, Armorel.' He
drew forth the packet&mdash;the case of shagreen&mdash;and laid it in Armorel's
lap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>'Keep them. I will not have them. Let me never see them.'
She gave them back to him quickly. 'Keep them out of my sight,
Roland. They are horrible things. They bring disaster and
destruction.'</p>

<p>'You will not have them? You positively refuse to have them?
Then I can keep them to myself. Why&mdash;that is brave!' He
opened the case and unrolled the silken wrapper.</p>

<p>'See, Armorel, the pretty things! They sparkle in the dying
light. Do you know that they are worth many thousands? You
have given me a fortune. I am rich at last. What is there in the
world to compare with being rich? Now I can buy anything I
want. The Way of Wealth is the Way of Pleasure. What did I
tell you? My feet were dragged into that way as if with ropes:
now they can go dancing of their own accord&mdash;no need to drag
them. They fly&mdash;they trip&mdash;they have wings. What is art?&mdash;what
is work?&mdash;what is the soul?&mdash;nothing! Here'&mdash;he took up
a handful of the stones and dropped them back again&mdash;'here,
Armorel, is what will purchase pleasure&mdash;solid comfort! I shall
live in ease and sloth: I shall do nothing: I shall feast every day:
everybody will call me a great painter because I am rich. Oh, I
have a splendid vision of the days to come, when I have turned
these glittering things into cash! Farewell drudgery&mdash;I am rich!
Farewell disappointment&mdash;I am rich! Farewell servitude&mdash;I am
rich! Farewell work and struggle&mdash;I am rich! Why should I
care any more for Art? I am rich, Armorel! I am rich!'</p>

<p>'That is not all you are going to say about the rubies, Roland.
Come to the conclusion.'</p>

<p>'Not quite all. In the old days I flung away everything for
the Way of Wealth and the Way of Pleasure&mdash;as I thought.
Good Heavens! What Wealth came to me? What Pleasure?
Well, Armorel, in your presence I now throw away the wealth.
Since you will not have it, I will not.'</p>

<p>He seized the case as if he would throw it overboard. She
leaned forward eagerly and stopped him.</p>

<p>'Will you really do this, Roland? Stop a moment. Think.
It is a great sacrifice. You might use that wealth for all kinds of
good and useful things. You could command the making of beautiful
things: you could help yourself in your Art: you could travel
and study&mdash;you could do a great deal, you know, with all this
money. Think, before you do what can never be undone.'</p>

<p>Roland, for reply, laid the rubies again in her lap. It was as
if one should bring a Trespass offering and lay it upon the altar.
The case was open, and the light was still strong enough overhead
for the rubies to be seen in a glittering heap.</p>

<p>He took them up again. 'Do you consent, Armorel?'</p>

<p>She bowed her head.</p>

<p>He took a handful of the stones and dropped them in the water.
There was a little splash, and the precious stones, the fortune of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Robert Fletcher, the gems of the Burmah mines, dropped like a
shower upon the surface. They were, as we know, nothing but
bits of paste and glass, but this he did not know. And therefore
the Trespass offering was rich and precious. Then he took the
silken kerchief which had wrapped them and threw the rest away,
as one throws into the sea a handful of pebbles picked up on the
beach.</p>

<p>'So,' he said, 'that is done. And now I am poor again.
You shall keep the empty case, Armorel, if you like.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no. I do not want even the case. I want never to be
reminded again of the rubies and the story of Robert Fletcher.'
Roland dipped the oars again, and with two or three vigorous
strokes pulled the boat out of the dark channel&mdash;the tomb of his
wealth&mdash;into the open water beyond. There in the dying light the
puffins swam and dived, and the sea-gulls screamed as they flew
overhead, and on the edge of the rocks the shags stood in meditative
rows.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Far away in the studio of the poet-painter&mdash;the cleverest man
in London&mdash;sat two who were uneasy with the same gnawing
anxiety. Roland Lee&mdash;they knew by this time&mdash;had the rubies.
When would the discovery be made? When would there be an
inquiry? What would come out? As the time goes on this
anxiety will grow less, but it will never wholly vanish. It will
change perhaps into curiosity as to what has been done with
those bits of glass and paste. Why has not Roland found out?
He must have given them to his wife, and she must have kept
them locked up. Some day it will be discovered that they are
valueless. But then it will be far too late for any inquiry. As
yet they do not speak to each other of the thing. It is too recent.
Roland Lee has but just acquired his fortune: he is still gloating
over the stones: he is building castles in the air: he is planning
his future. When he finds out the truth about them&mdash;what will
happen then?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'I have had a bad dream of temptation with rubies, Armorel.
Temptation harder than you would believe. How calm is the sea
to-night! How warm the air! The last light of the west lies on
your cheek, and&mdash;Armorel! Oh! Armorel!'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was nearly six o'clock, long after dark, when the two came
home. They walked over the hill hand in hand. They entered
the room hand in hand, their faces grave and solemn. I know
not what things had been said between them, but they were things
quite sacred. Only the lighter things&mdash;the things of the surface&mdash;the
things that everybody expects&mdash;can be set down concerning
love. The tears stood in Armorel's eyes. And, as if Effie had not
been in the room at all, she held out both her hands for her lover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
to take, and when he bent his head she raised her face to meet his
lips.</p>

<p>'You have come back to me, Roland,' she said. 'You have
grown so tall&mdash;so tall&mdash;grown to your full height. Welcome
home!'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At seven the door opened and the serving-folk came in. First
marched Justinian, bowed and bent, but still active. Then Dorcas,
also bowed and bent, but active. Then Chessun. Effie turned
down the lamp.</p>

<p>Dorcas stood for a moment, while Chessun placed the chairs,
gazing upon Roland, who stood erect as a soldier surveyed by his
captain.</p>

<p>'You have got a good face,' she said, 'if a loving face is a good
face. If you love her you will make her happy. If she loves you
your lot is happy. If you deserve her, you are not far from the
Kingdom of Heaven.'</p>

<p>'Your words, Dorcas,' he replied, 'are of good omen.'</p>

<p>'Chessun shall make a posset to-night,' she said. 'If ever a
posset was made, one shall be made to-night&mdash;a sherry posset! I
remember the posset for your mother, Armorel, and for your
grandmother, the first day she came here with her sweetheart. A
sherry posset you shall have&mdash;hot and strong!'</p>

<p>The old man sat down and threw small lumps of coal upon the
fire. Then the flames leaped up, and the red light played about the
room and showed the golden torque round Armorel's neck and
played upon her glowing face as she took her fiddle and stood up in
the old place to play to them in the old fashion.</p>

<p>Dorcas sat opposite her husband. At her left hand, Chessun
with her spinning-wheel. It was all&mdash;except for the Ancient Lady
and the hooded chair&mdash;all exactly as Roland remembered it nearly
six years before. Yet, as Armorel said, though outside there was
the music of the waves and within the music of her violin&mdash;the
music was set to other words and arranged for another key.
Between himself of that time and of the present, how great a
gulf!</p>

<p>Armorel finished tuning, and looked towards her master.</p>

<p>'"Dissembling Love"!' he commanded. ''Tis a moving piece,
and you play it rarely, "Dissembling Love"!'</p>
